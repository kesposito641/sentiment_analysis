Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",ACN

0,1613548733.0,"Hey guys. So I am a total newb here and have just learned that my grandfather, 20 years ago (29 years old now), made a Mutual Funds Account for me. He invested 15,000 dollars into it. It was invested as such:

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

&#x200B;

I am really new to this. So I am sorry I do not know much.",A

[https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

The stock has a moderate buy rating, with a price target of 10. This means that the company has an upside potential of more than 300%.This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.",A

My idea is to use the uni equipment and clinic to research and apply the material, make clinical trials to test my new material. Make no mistake, this will be a hassle over chemistry books and then when I find the right one I will have to delve over physiology, biology, dentistry and prosthetics books to make it useful. If the clinical trials come back positive then I can have a product that's worth investing. If I can come up with a good product this will be a competitive alternative with no other competition in the market because people simply won't know how to copy and a patent will be on point. I imagine this will be a 3 to 4 year research and struggle. Entrepreneurs say you have to invest in something you're passionate about, and I love chemistry and biology.

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

\- STABILITY: the company will not collapse and takes away my stocks. (the more stable the better, based on news)

Thank you very much for help in advanced. ;)",A
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",A

So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",A

I would like to put a list of questions together that might be relevant to me, the investor. 

This company is involved in rapidly charging battery technology. They have gone through their Series A and B rounds and have completed all their fundraising, and are working toward executing the purchase orders they’ve received, procuring grant monies, continuing to develop technology, marketing themselves to companies like Tesla and cell phone companies, and things of that nature. 

Our investment is in the form of a convertible loan. The company is current with all interest payments. Our main questions are obviously geared toward profitability as well as the timeline for when our interest in the firm will convert to ownership shares. We will also ask questions regarding revenue projections, profitability, and other debt structures than ours.

I keep seeing ads for it on my feed and from the sounds of it, it seems like a great idea. If you don’t know, supposedly it’s an app that invests the change from your purchases. So you spend 5.45 on something, then it’ll invest that 55 cents that’s leftover I guess? That’s my understanding of how it works.

I’m not usually one to succumb to ads but I figure right now, since I have very, very, very, little money coming in due to covid-19, it may be a good thing to start. That is of course, if 1. It’s trustworthy, and 2. It’s at all viable.

I'm a founder of stockval ([https://stockval.co](https://stockval.co/)).

Stockval is a lightweight realtime stock market price tracker with *anonymous* portfolios and alerts. It's loginless. No personal data. Still, your portfolios and alerts stay on our server and are accessible via a unique URL.

So why stockval? There are hundreds of portfolio trackers out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a simple one that would be fast enough, have realtime prices and worked well on all devices. All I found seemed to be extremely bloated.

I've been tweaking stockval for over a year. Today, I finally decided to share this lightweight app with you, guys.

Please make sure you try all features, bookmark a customised URL (e.g. [https://stockval.co/10fb/usd](https://stockval.co/10fb/usd) or [https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd](https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd)), create a portfolio, save some alerts, and then share the app with your friends if you like it.

All the feedback is appreciated! Thanks!

I posted the above question, here:

* https://www.startengine.com/brightlocker

I found [Brightlocker](https://www.brightlocker.com/) via these subreddits:

* /r/GameDeals
* /r/GameDealsFree
* /r/FreeGameFindings

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

So, basically I'm looking an investment that seems risky to me, but adding the fact there will be no dividends (and investors can't vote), and I'm struggling to understand how anyone can see this as a smart thing to invest in.",A

**First stock is**  **Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the** **FDA.** **This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache. As far as the buy price, the stock is trading at about 0.65, In my opinion is a really good buy.**

This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.  

# The penny stock is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq.

Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**
* **Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.**
* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.**

[https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",ARE

For each company I’m going to cover 5 points: First a very quick company overview, second big news and so what is the next major catalyst. Of course remember that penny stock are a very high risk high reward investment so make sure to diversify your portfolio!

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",ARE

Hi everyone Today I’m going to talk about 6 stocks: greenpro capital, ocugen , Peabody energy, ideanomics, phunware and bionano genomics. I’m going to analyze them quickly and give you my thoughts. If you want more details watch the video! [https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0](https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0)

The first stock is greenpro capital or grnq. with strategic offices across Asia, is a business incubator with a diversified business portfolio comprising finance, technology, banking, CryptoSx for STOs. With 30 years of experience in various industries, Greenpro has been assisting and supporting businesses and High-Net-Worth-Individuals to capitalize and securitize their value on a global scale through the provision of cross-border business solutions and spinoffs on major stock exchanges. Today it announced that its incubator company, Global Leaders Corporation ""GLC"" has filed a registration statement to be listed on US stock exchange! It is a company with a focus on start-up advisory and corporate consulting services, targeting start-up companies and young entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region.  

The second stock is ocugen or OCGN on Nasdaq. Ocugen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative therapies to treat blindness diseases. Ocugen announced binding letter of an intent with bharat biotech for co-development of Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the U.S. market, earlier this morning. this COVID collaboration could be a significant source of non-dilutive funding and potential revenue for the company, which now has the opportunity to work alongside a company that has had success in the space. 

Next stock is Ideanomics or IDEX on Nasdaq. It operates as a financial technology company. The Company focuses on facilitating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles and developing next-generation financial services and Fintech products. Today it announced that it has signed a deal for the purchase of 2,000 EVs for ride-hailing services and deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of next year. The company is currently investing in electric vehicles and EV battery sales as well as the blockchain industry, that in my opinion will be very important trend in the future. 

Next we have bionano genomics or bngo on Nasdaq! The company provides a platform to analyze the long segments of genomic DNA and other biomolecules structural variations and has highlighted the results of a recently published preprint study demonstrating the superiority of its optical mapping technology for detecting large structural variations and also as you can see here there are a lot of very good news about this company.

Its primary business consists of the mining, sale, and distribution of coal, which is purchased for use in electricity generation and steelmaking. Shares of several oil companies are trading higher as oil prices rise following an attack on two Iraqi wells. The start of the vaccine rollout has also lifted demand outlook. 

Last we have Phunware or Phun on Nasdaq. It is the pioneer of Multiscreen-as-a-Service (MaaS), an award winning, fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile that provides companies the products, solutions, data and services necessary to engage, manage and monetize their mobile application portfolios and audiences globally at scale. today the company announced its receipt of the Privacy Shield certification.

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5.

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",ARE

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq.

[https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw](https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw)

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform. So in my opinion once they announce good news, the stock will probably go up a lot.",ARE
0,1611955893.0,"  

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",ARE
0,1608350789.0," 

This would be the list of the stocks to avoid at the moment in my opinion, some of you might not agree with this and that's fine:

1. Intel: Major US company that had lots of potentials. Now run by a boomer, who has no idea what he's doing, only smile for the camera. The company loses 20% in less than a week. What did they do? Nothing.
2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.
4. PLTR: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up. + Besides the same argument as the one I made for TSLA, the company is yet to make a profit.

If anyone has any other point of view, feel free to comment. Also, I can make a list of the companies everyone should buy NOW. Have a great one all!",ARE

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

\- STABILITY: the company will not collapse and takes away my stocks. (the more stable the better, based on news)

Thank you very much for help in advanced. ;)",ARE

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate!

Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",ARE

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

&#x200B;

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy. 

Remember this is my opinion. This is not bound to happen and if you don't agree with that, that's fine. I am long on shares of AAPL, BABA, PFE and NIO.",ARE

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",ARE
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",ARE

The investor group is making a visit to the company and will have an audience with the CEO and several other key members of the organization. 

I would like to put a list of questions together that might be relevant to me, the investor. 

This company is involved in rapidly charging battery technology. They have gone through their Series A and B rounds and have completed all their fundraising, and are working toward executing the purchase orders they’ve received, procuring grant monies, continuing to develop technology, marketing themselves to companies like Tesla and cell phone companies, and things of that nature. 

Our investment is in the form of a convertible loan. The company is current with all interest payments. Our main questions are obviously geared toward profitability as well as the timeline for when our interest in the firm will convert to ownership shares. We will also ask questions regarding revenue projections, profitability, and other debt structures than ours. 

I am wondering what other, important questions I might ask the CEO, and thought to reach out to reddit to find some good, key questions.",ARE

I'm not looking to make millions, just some some steady monthly/quarterly incomes in terms of like...few hundred dollars. I'm from Romania, we don't have so big paychecks, the medium salary is about 800 USD / per month. In my country, it is quite hard to earn and have a good living if you are a simple employee and the government is not really helping new businesses, so I'm trying to find a way to raise my monthly income. For the past 7 months i've been reasearching about shares and things to invest my money in, but in the end, my conclusion is that without consistent investments, the winnings are really, really low.  So, what I'm asking is, what would you do if you had $1000 to invest and you were able to add about $200 more each month to it? In this way, is it even possible to have a steady monthly income of a few hundred dollars after a 1-2 years?

I can't seem to find any good info on this type of land. Everything I find tends to be residential or commercial zoned stuff.

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave. If their set up wasn’t so difficult for people with ASD, SPD, Anxiety etc - think about how much more business they would get. 

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers.

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",ARE

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

Best regards,

Hi everyone, today we’re going to talk about 3 Stocks that have the potential to do more than 400%! I think they’re all really solid companies with a lot of momentum and they can go up a lot.

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq.

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned.

This would be the list of the stocks to avoid at the moment in my opinion, some of you might not agree with this and that's fine:

1. Intel: Major US company that had lots of potentials. Now run by a boomer, who has no idea what he's doing, only smile for the camera. The company loses 20% in less than a week. What did they do? Nothing.
2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.
4. PLTR: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up. + Besides the same argument as the one I made for TSLA, the company is yet to make a profit.

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

**Hi everyone, today I’m going to talk about penny stocks that have a lot of potential to double or even triple in the short term and to do ever more in the long term. I think all of these companies have strong catalyst and could deliver some very good return. If you want more information such as price targets and at what price I’m buying this stock, you can watch the video!**  **https://youtu.be/zqOyVL7ETXI**

**First stock is**  **Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the** **FDA.** **This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache. As far as the buy price, the stock is trading at about 0.65, In my opinion is a really good buy.** 

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq. It is a pharmaceutical company, focuses on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases. Its pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos and ACER-001, for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and osanetant for the treatment of induced Vasomotor Symptoms. The company has a research collaboration agreement with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to develop emetine hydrochloride as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19; and a license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to osanetant, a clinical-stage, selective, and non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.  

# The penny stock is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**
* **Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.**
* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.** 

**Next company is Genetic Technologies Limited ticker symbol on nasdaq GENE), it**  **is a diversified molecular diagnostics company.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",ALLE
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",ALLE
0,1606759110.0,"Hi All,

I recently hit a milestone in my high-yield savings account ($75k) and now I am looking to set up bi-weekly investments into ETFs. I plan on using my capital to invest in residential multi-family real estate deals in the future so I’m just looking to make some extra earnings on my capital moving forward.

I’m looking at investing in SPY (50%), ICLN (20%), and VGT (30%) on a bi-weekly basis. Does anyone have other ETF suggestions? My plan is to make bi-weekly investments (~$2,500/month) and be able to cash out of these investments (if needed) in 1-5 years for real estate deals, wedding, etc.

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy.

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",ALLE
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",ALLE

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery.

And also a lot recently commented that their overall sales funnel continues to accelerate and it is foreseeable that the Q3 ending sales plus contracts number may exceed the 133% growth noted in a prior press release. And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Our thinking at the time was that we intend to use the money for a down payment on a house and were concerned that market volatility might give it a real whack just when the timing was wrong for us. 

Of course, the last 12 months have seen strong growth in the market, so we're now wondering if we should get back in for the next year, because we probably won't be looking to buy in that period and could potentially pocket some decent gains (they sure would have been this year). 

What I'm asking is what the most rational decision is at this point. Should we:

a) Get back in with all of it, because the market is not going to have a big huge drop in the next 18 months, splitting between our conservative and aggressive funds again

b) Get back in with some of it, because that way we don't totally miss out on any growth but also don't lose our shirts if things go south

c) Stay out completely, because we don't *need* growth in order for our nest egg to work for us, it would just be nice, and if the market pulls a 2008, the nest egg actually will no longer serve the purpose for which it is intended.

&#x200B;

I've been asked to finance a small cafè. I will be putting all the money to get the activity started, including works, machinery permits, etc... We are talking 20,000 USD more or less. My partner who found this opportunity will be the manager of the place (putting no money in at the beginning). He counts on having three employees running the place making his job just management activities that he will do while working another job.

He assigned himself a monthly salary for his job and 80% of the ownership of the cafe. I will be awarded a 20% of the cafe and will get revenues at the end of the year proportionally, about 10,000USD. Also the cafè will pay back my loan with a 6% interest rate in two years, generating 2000 dolalrs revenue.

Does this sound fair? I'm taking all the financia risk and if we go broke we will loose most of the investment as we are renting the place and the machinery is a small portion of the expense...

I would kindly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions,

Thanks!",ALLE

I’m using HL as an investment platform. Qs are 

1. I was thinking that it’s too skewed on bonds - thoughts?
2. I was thinking about swapping one of the bond funds for a healthcare fund - thoughts? Additionally, something that would give me a huge exposure to Africa cheaply.
3. So far, every fund is to be weighted at 12.5% - should i focus on some sectors more or less?
4. I’m thinking about using LISA as a wrapper but I’m not sure that with LISA I’ll be able to buy a house so it’s more of a retirement savings. 
5. So far, I’m putting money into normal ISA. 

I can safely put away 4-5k a year, so what I want is constant growth so that at ‘later age’ (i’m 28 now) i’ll have a stable income. I don’t think I’m very willing to wait till I'm 60, I'll hopefully increase my income so I can increase my contributions and retire (FIRE?) early.

I posted the above question, here:

* https://www.startengine.com/brightlocker

I found [Brightlocker](https://www.brightlocker.com/) via these subreddits:

* /r/GameDeals
* /r/GameDealsFree
* /r/FreeGameFindings

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

So, basically I'm looking an investment that seems risky to me, but adding the fact there will be no dividends (and investors can't vote), and I'm struggling to understand how anyone can see this as a smart thing to invest in.",ALLE

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

Best regards,

FirstEURTrillionaire.

For each company I’m going to give you a quick overview and news, if you want more info about price target and when and at what time I’m buying, you can watch the video! [https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq. It is a pharmaceutical company, focuses on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases. Its pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos and ACER-001, for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and osanetant for the treatment of induced Vasomotor Symptoms.

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq.

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned.

This would be the list of the stocks to avoid at the moment in my opinion, some of you might not agree with this and that's fine:

1. Intel: Major US company that had lots of potentials. Now run by a boomer, who has no idea what he's doing, only smile for the camera. The company loses 20% in less than a week. What did they do? Nothing.
2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.
4. PLTR: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up. + Besides the same argument as the one I made for TSLA, the company is yet to make a profit.

**First stock is**  **Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the** **FDA.** **This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache. As far as the buy price, the stock is trading at about 0.65, In my opinion is a really good buy.** 

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq. It is a pharmaceutical company, focuses on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases. Its pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos and ACER-001, for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and osanetant for the treatment of induced Vasomotor Symptoms. The company has a research collaboration agreement with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to develop emetine hydrochloride as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19; and a license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to osanetant, a clinical-stage, selective, and non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.  

# The penny stock is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**
* **Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.**
* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.**

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",ALL
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",ALL
0,1606759110.0,"Hi All,

I recently hit a milestone in my high-yield savings account ($75k) and now I am looking to set up bi-weekly investments into ETFs. I plan on using my capital to invest in residential multi-family real estate deals in the future so I’m just looking to make some extra earnings on my capital moving forward.

I’m looking at investing in SPY (50%), ICLN (20%), and VGT (30%) on a bi-weekly basis. Does anyone have other ETF suggestions? My plan is to make bi-weekly investments (~$2,500/month) and be able to cash out of these investments (if needed) in 1-5 years for real estate deals, wedding, etc. 

PS, already have a Roth IRA, 401k and pension plan. I am looking at this brokerage account/ETF strategy as an additional savings tool that I can earn more $ compared to a savings account and liquidate if I see the need.

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy. 

Remember this is my opinion. This is not bound to happen and if you don't agree with that, that's fine. I am long on shares of AAPL, BABA, PFE and NIO.",ALL

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",ALL
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",ALL

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery.

Phase 2 solves the problem of “Management”. I don’t think I’m alone in my investing struggles above.

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

Of course, the last 12 months have seen strong growth in the market, so we're now wondering if we should get back in for the next year, because we probably won't be looking to buy in that period and could potentially pocket some decent gains (they sure would have been this year). 

What I'm asking is what the most rational decision is at this point. Should we:

a) Get back in with all of it, because the market is not going to have a big huge drop in the next 18 months, splitting between our conservative and aggressive funds again

b) Get back in with some of it, because that way we don't totally miss out on any growth but also don't lose our shirts if things go south

c) Stay out completely, because we don't *need* growth in order for our nest egg to work for us, it would just be nice, and if the market pulls a 2008, the nest egg actually will no longer serve the purpose for which it is intended.

My partner who found this opportunity will be the manager of the place (putting no money in at the beginning). He counts on having three employees running the place making his job just management activities that he will do while working another job.

He assigned himself a monthly salary for his job and 80% of the ownership of the cafe. I will be awarded a 20% of the cafe and will get revenues at the end of the year proportionally, about 10,000USD. Also the cafè will pay back my loan with a 6% interest rate in two years, generating 2000 dolalrs revenue.

Does this sound fair? I'm taking all the financia risk and if we go broke we will loose most of the investment as we are renting the place and the machinery is a small portion of the expense...

I’m using HL as an investment platform. Qs are 

1. I was thinking that it’s too skewed on bonds - thoughts?
2. I was thinking about swapping one of the bond funds for a healthcare fund - thoughts? Additionally, something that would give me a huge exposure to Africa cheaply.
3. So far, every fund is to be weighted at 12.5% - should i focus on some sectors more or less?
4. I’m thinking about using LISA as a wrapper but I’m not sure that with LISA I’ll be able to buy a house so it’s more of a retirement savings. 
5. So far, I’m putting money into normal ISA. 

I can safely put away 4-5k a year, so what I want is constant growth so that at ‘later age’ (i’m 28 now) i’ll have a stable income. I don’t think I’m very willing to wait till I'm 60, I'll hopefully increase my income so I can increase my contributions and retire (FIRE?) early.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts greatly appreciated!",ALL

I posted the above question, here:

* https://www.startengine.com/brightlocker

I found [Brightlocker](https://www.brightlocker.com/) via these subreddits:

* /r/GameDeals
* /r/GameDealsFree
* /r/FreeGameFindings

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

So, basically I'm looking an investment that seems risky to me, but adding the fact there will be no dividends (and investors can't vote), and I'm struggling to understand how anyone can see this as a smart thing to invest in.",ALL

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy.

Stockval is a lightweight realtime stock market price tracker with *anonymous* portfolios and alerts. It's loginless. No personal data. Still, your portfolios and alerts stay on our server and are accessible via a unique URL.

So why stockval? There are hundreds of portfolio trackers out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a simple one that would be fast enough, have realtime prices and worked well on all devices. All I found seemed to be extremely bloated.

I've been tweaking stockval for over a year. Today, I finally decided to share this lightweight app with you, guys.

Please make sure you try all features, bookmark a customised URL (e.g. [https://stockval.co/10fb/usd](https://stockval.co/10fb/usd) or [https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd](https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd)), create a portfolio, save some alerts, and then share the app with your friends if you like it.

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave. If their set up wasn’t so difficult for people with ASD, SPD, Anxiety etc - think about how much more business they would get. 

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers. 

I also am a little worried posting here in case my full business plan (I have waaaaaay more research and things written up) is stolen and someone else runs with i.

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

So, basically I'm looking an investment that seems risky to me, but adding the fact there will be no dividends (and investors can't vote), and I'm struggling to understand how anyone can see this as a smart thing to invest in.",T

The only phrase you need to read, is this one:

> the carbon emissions generated by the electricity required for electric vehicles are greater than those saved by cutting out direct vehicle emissions.

That phrase has deceptive double-speak. The words ""greater than those saved"" is where the deception is. If I buy a sandwich for $10, and I use a coupon for a $4 discount (""those saved""), my cost is $6, and it's ""greater than those saved"" ($4). So, the entire basis for this article is basically saying ""Don't buy the sandwich because $6 is still more than the $4 discount"".

Total BS.

I'll call him ""Idiot"". Yeah, I swear it's not me, it is he. Idiot has tons of USD invested in Bitcoin. He's not diversified even a little bit, and no amount of begging can persuade him to put some aside in case something goes wrong. He's all-in.

I have literally begged him to diversify with at least 3% to 5% of his money. That's such a tiny fraction of his wealth, it's almost forgettable. However, if something does indeed go wrong with his Bitcoin investments, a few it will be more than enough to either start fresh, or retire permanently to rest on his laurels. No amount of begging can sway him. He's convinced every cent should be in Bitcoin.

Although I swear this is about my ""friend"" Idiot, not about me, I'm actually in a similar circumstance. I am all-in with rare modern Chinese coins (MCC). They have been very profitable, and low risk. Not as impressive as Bitcoin profits, but still quite good, and the low risk part makes me feel very comfortable. So, in short, I'm obviously a hypocrite, and thus my ""friend"" Idiot won't listen to me.

A breakthrough in mathematics, computing, cryptography, security bugs, or any combination could erase billions of Bitcoin dollars in seconds. How does a hypocrite like me convince my ""friend"" Idiot that he desperately needs to diversify?",T

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform.

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",ATO

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential.

If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned.

0,1610053600.0,"Hi everyone Today I’m going to cover 4 penny stocks that are: 9 meter biopharma, orchad therapeutics and Sundial growers. This penny stock cost respectively and have a very high potential to double or even triple their value in the short term and to do even more in the long term. For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",BIO
0,1609614337.0,"Hi everyone, today I wanted to talk about 6 penny stocks I’ve found that could potentially double or even triple their value very soon. For each company I’m going to cover 5 points: First a very quick company overview, second big news and so what is the next major catalyst. Of course remember that penny stock are a very high risk high reward investment so make sure to diversify your portfolio!

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

**Matinas BioPharma or MTNB on NYSE it’s a biopharmaceutical company .**By using its lipid nano-crystal platform (LNC) delivery technology, Matinas BioPharma hopes to solve complex challenges related to the oral delivery of small molecules, gene therapies, vaccines, proteins and peptides. Currently going for $1.36 a per share but  several members of the Street believe its share price presents an attractive entry point.The big catalyst right now is mat2203 , that in simple world is the first primary broad-spectrum treatment for immunocompromised patient. It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",BIO

Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**

* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.**

I recently hit a milestone in my high-yield savings account ($75k) and now I am looking to set up bi-weekly investments into ETFs. I plan on using my capital to invest in residential multi-family real estate deals in the future so I’m just looking to make some extra earnings on my capital moving forward.

I’m looking at investing in SPY (50%), ICLN (20%), and VGT (30%) on a bi-weekly basis. Does anyone have other ETF suggestions? My plan is to make bi-weekly investments (~$2,500/month) and be able to cash out of these investments (if needed) in 1-5 years for real estate deals, wedding, etc.

Here is my thought - I think Ford has to become cool or it will slowly die and their new CEO knows it. There is nothing special about the company now and price is showing it. So unlike other car companies that can play it safe, Ford has to take radical steps and reinvent itself.

I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one.

That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform.

Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",COST

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",COST
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",COST
0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",COST
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",COST

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever!

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",COST

Hi everyone, today I wanted to talk about 5 penny stocks that costs arround 2 or 3 dollars, one even 13 cents  and have very high potential to double or even triple they’re value. If you want more information watch the video! [https://youtu.be/V-YbpVzM0a8](https://youtu.be/V-YbpVzM0a8)

The first stock is colorstar technology or cscw on Nasdaq. through its subsidiaries, provides online and offline music education services in the United States throught CACM Group NY and China. It also offers Color World, an online cultural entertainment platform that provides celebrity lectures, celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, and artist interactive communication.. Color World App offers both a Chinese version, which launched on September 10, 2020 and an international version, to be launched by the end of 2020. Since its launch in less than three months ago, the Chinese version has already attracted over 600,000 registered users and over 50 celebrity coaches. The revenue is set to grow a lot in the next years, doubling from 2021 to 2022 and to grow even more in the following years. 

Next stock is gevo incorporation or gevo on Nasdaq. It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Shares climbed this week after the [alternative fuel](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/) specialist announced that it had exercised an option to purchase 239 acres of land in South Dakota, capitalizing on an expansion opportunity. It also said it had met the first milestone in its $1.5 billion contract with Trafigura, a commodities trading company, to secure control of a site by the end of the year. In August, the company signed the deal -- the biggest contract in its history -- to provide Trafigura with 25 million gallons per year in fuel, most of which will be renewable gasoline. 

Than we have artificial intelligence or aitx on over the country markets. It is a holding company, and it’s subsidiaries are all companies in the robotic and Artificial intelligence sector. This week the holding announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) has received an order from a large construction company for what RAD expects as the first of many [ROSA](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Froboticassistancedevices.com%2Frosa%2F&esheet=52329709&newsitemid=20201117005699&lan=en-US&anchor=ROSA&index=1&md5=41d294732eff6f7048b61b36205eb744)unit , is a self-contained, artificial intelligence to be deployed at the client’s managed properties across the United States. And also a lot recently commented that their overall sales funnel continues to accelerate and it is foreseeable that the Q3 ending sales plus contracts number may exceed the 133% growth noted in a prior press release. And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money. The revenue of the company has grown a lot, going from 14 million in 2018, to 28 in 2019 and 24 in 2020, but without q4, so it is expected to be over 30 million. This growth rate is pretty good, considering that they’re also cutting a lot the cost of the revenue! 

**Last we have MIND Technology**, **Inc**. provides **technology** and solutions for exploration, survey, and defense applications in oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic, and security industries. The **Company** designs, manufactures, and sells specialized, high performance sonar and seismic equipment. The balance shit for the company is improving year by year, as you can see from the graph the debt is going down and the cash flow it’s kinda improving in the long term, but of course it took a big hit in 2020.

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

That phrase has deceptive double-speak. The words ""greater than those saved"" is where the deception is.

0,1489435780.0,"**Precious metals IRA's** are a great way to diversify your investment portfolio and protect your nest egg from inflation and/or fluctuations in the stock market.  

Traditionally, precious metals have been considered a safe haven investment because they increase in value as the dollar looses value.  This is due in part to two factors.  Firstly the cost of mining those metals increases over the years due largely to inflation.  As inflation rises, so do production costs which in turn increase the asking price of the metal.  The second factor is supply and demand.  As the name implies precious metals are precious because their quantity is limited.  Because the quantity available is limited the demand is sometimes greater than the supply.  Its during those times that precious metals prices increase substantially.  

Most modern economists consider precious metals to be an insurance policy or hedge against inflation more than a traditional investment.  This is because the price of precious metals is tied closely to inflation.  As I mentioned preciously as inflation increases so to do mining and production costs, which lead to the asking price of the refined metal increasing in turn.  Like many long term investments a precious metals IRA has been shown to have less risk than some of the more traditional investments like stocks or ETF's.  It is because of these characteristics that Texas Bullion feels strongly about the long term benefits of owning precious metals.

2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.

As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10.

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",RE

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.

That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States.

And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform.

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero!

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",RE

Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh.

So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",RE

0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",RE

For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever!

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy.

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",RE

It also offers Color World, an online cultural entertainment platform that provides celebrity lectures, celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, and artist interactive communication..

Since its launch in less than three months ago, the Chinese version has already attracted over 600,000 registered users and over 50 celebrity coaches. The revenue is set to grow a lot in the next years, doubling from 2021 to 2022 and to grow even more in the following years. 

Next stock is gevo incorporation or gevo on Nasdaq. It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Shares climbed this week after the [alternative fuel](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/) specialist announced that it had exercised an option to purchase 239 acres of land in South Dakota, capitalizing on an expansion opportunity. It also said it had met the first milestone in its $1.5 billion contract with Trafigura, a commodities trading company, to secure control of a site by the end of the year. In August, the company signed the deal -- the biggest contract in its history -- to provide Trafigura with 25 million gallons per year in fuel, most of which will be renewable gasoline.

And also a lot recently commented that their overall sales funnel continues to accelerate and it is foreseeable that the Q3 ending sales plus contracts number may exceed the 133% growth noted in a prior press release. And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money. The revenue of the company has grown a lot, going from 14 million in 2018, to 28 in 2019 and 24 in 2020, but without q4, so it is expected to be over 30 million.

I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first.

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula.

Of course, the last 12 months have seen strong growth in the market, so we're now wondering if we should get back in for the next year, because we probably won't be looking to buy in that period and could potentially pocket some decent gains (they sure would have been this year). 

What I'm asking is what the most rational decision is at this point. Should we:

a) Get back in with all of it, because the market is not going to have a big huge drop in the next 18 months, splitting between our conservative and aggressive funds again

b) Get back in with some of it, because that way we don't totally miss out on any growth but also don't lose our shirts if things go south

c) Stay out completely, because we don't *need* growth in order for our nest egg to work for us, it would just be nice, and if the market pulls a 2008, the nest egg actually will no longer serve the purpose for which it is intended.

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

0,1506789831.0,"The news is full of anti-gold articles. I believe that means someone powerful is buying. Who? People who have the ability to dictate to media outlets what kinds of things they talk about. It probably isn't any one group or person behind this. Instead, it's more likely just a lot of people who have noticed the direction the world economy is moving in, so they try mask their buying by pushing prices down. 

Big buyers can easily cause market distortion and unsustainable price gains that will collapse after they stop buying. To prevent that, they use their influence to put negative news in the media about whatever it is they're buying. That pushes away a certain about of investment each day, so The Powers That Be can make those investments themselves while either sustaining prices or causing them to drop.

After they're done buying, or when the world markets reach a point where the prices can't be suppressed anymore, prices rise and quick profits are earned. Rinse and repeat.

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

C) wait for condo to pay itself off with rental $ (don’t get any interest tax benefit cause of current home)
D) other?

I was raised to think debts are bad and you should pay off your house as fast as you can.
Been hearing that i shouldn’t be afraid of debt and use (if I sell) $200k for the market, which will probably outperform my interest rate/refi rate.

I'm a founder of stockval ([https://stockval.co](https://stockval.co/)).

Stockval is a lightweight realtime stock market price tracker with *anonymous* portfolios and alerts. It's loginless. No personal data. Still, your portfolios and alerts stay on our server and are accessible via a unique URL.

So why stockval? There are hundreds of portfolio trackers out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a simple one that would be fast enough, have realtime prices and worked well on all devices. All I found seemed to be extremely bloated.

I've been tweaking stockval for over a year. Today, I finally decided to share this lightweight app with you, guys.

Please make sure you try all features, bookmark a customised URL (e.g. [https://stockval.co/10fb/usd](https://stockval.co/10fb/usd) or [https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd](https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd)), create a portfolio, save some alerts, and then share the app with your friends if you like it.

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",FLS

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",IT

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10.

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",IT

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq. It is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications. The stock right now has two candidates in it’s pipeline, galinpepimut-s and nelipepimut-s. The first one is the flashship product of the company it  targets malignancies and tumors characterized by an overexpression of the WT1 antigen. The WT1 antigen is one of the most widely expressed cancer antigens in multiple malignancies. It has been ranked by the NCI as the top priority among cancer antigens for immunotherapyand and right now is being tested for various form of cancer, while the second one is being investigated only for breast cancer and has finished phase 2.

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,.

This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform. So in my opinion once they announce good news, the stock will probably go up a lot.",IT
0,1611955893.0,"  

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential.

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.

This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero!

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

\- STABILITY: the company will not collapse and takes away my stocks. (the more stable the better, based on news)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

**Hi everyone, today I’m going to talk about penny stocks that have a lot of potential to double or even triple in the short term and to do ever more in the long term. I think all of these companies have strong catalyst and could deliver some very good return. If you want more information such as price targets and at what price I’m buying this stock, you can watch the video!**  **https://youtu.be/zqOyVL7ETXI**

**First stock is**  **Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the** **FDA.** **This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache. As far as the buy price, the stock is trading at about 0.65, In my opinion is a really good buy.** 

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq. It is a pharmaceutical company, focuses on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases. Its pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos and ACER-001, for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and osanetant for the treatment of induced Vasomotor Symptoms. The company has a research collaboration agreement with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to develop emetine hydrochloride as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19; and a license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to osanetant, a clinical-stage, selective, and non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.  

# The penny stock is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**
* **Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.**
* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.** 

**Next company is Genetic Technologies Limited ticker symbol on nasdaq GENE), it**  **is a diversified molecular diagnostics company.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",IT
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",IT

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy.

0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",IT

For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever!

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

Currently going for $1.36 a per share but  several members of the Street believe its share price presents an attractive entry point.The big catalyst right now is mat2203 , that in simple world is the first primary broad-spectrum treatment for immunocompromised patient. It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",IT

The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Shares climbed this week after the [alternative fuel](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/) specialist announced that it had exercised an option to purchase 239 acres of land in South Dakota, capitalizing on an expansion opportunity. It also said it had met the first milestone in its $1.5 billion contract with Trafigura, a commodities trading company, to secure control of a site by the end of the year.

Than we have artificial intelligence or aitx on over the country markets. It is a holding company, and it’s subsidiaries are all companies in the robotic and Artificial intelligence sector.

And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money.

The **Company** designs, manufactures, and sells specialized, high performance sonar and seismic equipment.

Hi everyone Today I’m going to talk about 6 stocks: greenpro capital, ocugen , Peabody energy, ideanomics, phunware and bionano genomics. I’m going to analyze them quickly and give you my thoughts. If you want more details watch the video! [https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0](https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0)

The first stock is greenpro capital or grnq. with strategic offices across Asia, is a business incubator with a diversified business portfolio comprising finance, technology, banking, CryptoSx for STOs. With 30 years of experience in various industries, Greenpro has been assisting and supporting businesses and High-Net-Worth-Individuals to capitalize and securitize their value on a global scale through the provision of cross-border business solutions and spinoffs on major stock exchanges. Today it announced that its incubator company, Global Leaders Corporation ""GLC"" has filed a registration statement to be listed on US stock exchange! It is a company with a focus on start-up advisory and corporate consulting services, targeting start-up companies and young entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region.  

The second stock is ocugen or OCGN on Nasdaq. Ocugen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative therapies to treat blindness diseases. Ocugen announced binding letter of an intent with bharat biotech for co-development of Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the U.S. market, earlier this morning. this COVID collaboration could be a significant source of non-dilutive funding and potential revenue for the company, which now has the opportunity to work alongside a company that has had success in the space. 

Next stock is Ideanomics or IDEX on Nasdaq. It operates as a financial technology company. The Company focuses on facilitating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles and developing next-generation financial services and Fintech products. Today it announced that it has signed a deal for the purchase of 2,000 EVs for ride-hailing services and deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of next year. The company is currently investing in electric vehicles and EV battery sales as well as the blockchain industry, that in my opinion will be very important trend in the future. 

Next we have bionano genomics or bngo on Nasdaq! The company provides a platform to analyze the long segments of genomic DNA and other biomolecules structural variations and has highlighted the results of a recently published preprint study demonstrating the superiority of its optical mapping technology for detecting large structural variations and also as you can see here there are a lot of very good news about this company. 

is Peabody energy or BTU on Nasdaq! is the largest private sector coal company in the world. Its primary business consists of the mining, sale, and distribution of coal, which is purchased for use in electricity generation and steelmaking. Shares of several oil companies are trading higher as oil prices rise following an attack on two Iraqi wells. The start of the vaccine rollout has also lifted demand outlook. 

Last we have Phunware or Phun on Nasdaq. It is the pioneer of Multiscreen-as-a-Service (MaaS), an award winning, fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile that provides companies the products, solutions, data and services necessary to engage, manage and monetize their mobile application portfolios and audiences globally at scale. today the company announced its receipt of the Privacy Shield certification.

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments.

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers.

    <badon> Amalynn: They say they do, but everyone else say they won't have for a few more months at least, because they need to do a nuclear test first. It's possible they have a squib warhead they could launch just to say they did, even though it won't perform as well as it would from a better design.
    <ddhk> yeah I think they can launch a missle that could possibley hit California and Alaska that's the last I read.
    <badon> ddhk: They would probably strike everyone if they can.
    <ddhk> I'm sure they'd like to but the don't have the ability to

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

0,1612989196.0,"Hi guys. I know this is boring but Ford has had some good momentum recently with new management and relatively low cost. Zack’s had it as Buy (#1) at the beginning of this week and it is rated a Buy by almost all analysts. Most recent forecast is at $14 (it is currently trading under $12).  

Here is my thought - I think Ford has to become cool or it will slowly die and their new CEO knows it. There is nothing special about the company now and price is showing it. So unlike other car companies that can play it safe, Ford has to take radical steps and reinvent itself.

0,1613548733.0,"Hey guys. So I am a total newb here and have just learned that my grandfather, 20 years ago (29 years old now), made a Mutual Funds Account for me. He invested 15,000 dollars into it. It was invested as such:

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

For each company I’m going to give you a quick overview and news, if you want more info about price target and when and at what time I’m buying, you can watch the video! [https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",HAS

It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq. It is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications. The stock right now has two candidates in it’s pipeline, galinpepimut-s and nelipepimut-s. The first one is the flashship product of the company it  targets malignancies and tumors characterized by an overexpression of the WT1 antigen. The WT1 antigen is one of the most widely expressed cancer antigens in multiple malignancies. It has been ranked by the NCI as the top priority among cancer antigens for immunotherapyand and right now is being tested for various form of cancer, while the second one is being investigated only for breast cancer and has finished phase 2. The company has also improved it’s balance sheet in 2020  with gross revenue of approximately $47.9 million from the sale of securities, exercise of warrants, and the upfront payment from 3D Medicines and we ended the year with approximately $35.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, that is plenty of cash to work with and go on with the studies.",HAS
0,1612037000.0,"Today, we’re going to talk about 5  biopharma penny stocks, I think they have some very strong catalyst and could have a very impressive run this year. If you want for more details, such as price targets and when I’m buying the stock,  you can watch the youtube video, it would be really appreciated But now, let’s get straight to the video! [https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw](https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw)

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform. So in my opinion once they announce good news, the stock will probably go up a lot.",HAS
0,1611955893.0,"  

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",HAS
0,1608350789.0," 

This would be the list of the stocks to avoid at the moment in my opinion, some of you might not agree with this and that's fine:

1. Intel: Major US company that had lots of potentials. Now run by a boomer, who has no idea what he's doing, only smile for the camera. The company loses 20% in less than a week. What did they do? Nothing.
2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.
4. PLTR: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up. + Besides the same argument as the one I made for TSLA, the company is yet to make a profit.

If anyone has any other point of view, feel free to comment. Also, I can make a list of the companies everyone should buy NOW. Have a great one all!",HAS

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

\- STABILITY: the company will not collapse and takes away my stocks. (the more stable the better, based on news)

Thank you very much for help in advanced. ;)",HAS

**Hi everyone, today I’m going to talk about penny stocks that have a lot of potential to double or even triple in the short term and to do ever more in the long term. I think all of these companies have strong catalyst and could deliver some very good return. If you want more information such as price targets and at what price I’m buying this stock, you can watch the video!**  **https://youtu.be/zqOyVL7ETXI**

**First stock is**  **Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",HAS
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",HAS

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

&#x200B;

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy. 

Remember this is my opinion. This is not bound to happen and if you don't agree with that, that's fine. I am long on shares of AAPL, BABA, PFE and NIO.",HAS
0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",HAS

This penny stock cost respectively and have a very high potential to double or even triple their value in the short term and to do even more in the long term. For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",HAS

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",HAS

The revenue is set to grow a lot in the next years, doubling from 2021 to 2022 and to grow even more in the following years. 

Next stock is gevo incorporation or gevo on Nasdaq.

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money.

I am 29 years old. I am autistic but HFA. I also suffer from Anxiety, Agoraphobia etc. 

Currently, the CDC states that there are 1 in 54 children somewhere on the spectrum. 

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave. If their set up wasn’t so difficult for people with ASD, SPD, Anxiety etc - think about how much more business they would get. 

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers. 

I also am a little worried posting here in case my full business plan (I have waaaaaay more research and things written up) is stolen and someone else runs with i.

So you spend 5.45 on something, then it’ll invest that 55 cents that’s leftover I guess? That’s my understanding of how it works.

I’m not usually one to succumb to ads but I figure right now, since I have very, very, very, little money coming in due to covid-19, it may be a good thing to start. That is of course, if 1. It’s trustworthy, and 2. It’s at all viable.

Has anyone else used that app or anything like it to make those kinds of investments? Is it worthwhile? Are there things you should know before diving in?",HAS

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",HAS

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

However, as you get to know markets, you want to capture more gains when the market soars up and focus on growth-oriented assets. Going with growth stocks like Amazon and Netflix are great, as is investing in ETFs and REITs. Mixing in cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin, is a great idea to capture growth in that area.

You can also look at blockchain startups to see if you can hit one that delivers explosive returns, like Ethereum has. Most of these blockchain organizations raise funds through ICOs, like Telegram, XResearch, Dragonchain, EOS, IDGO, CustomCoin, etc.

I found [Brightlocker](https://www.brightlocker.com/) via these subreddits:

* /r/GameDeals
* /r/GameDealsFree
* /r/FreeGameFindings

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

0,1489435780.0,"**Precious metals IRA's** are a great way to diversify your investment portfolio and protect your nest egg from inflation and/or fluctuations in the stock market.  

Traditionally, precious metals have been considered a safe haven investment because they increase in value as the dollar looses value.  This is due in part to two factors.  Firstly the cost of mining those metals increases over the years due largely to inflation.  As inflation rises, so do production costs which in turn increase the asking price of the metal.  The second factor is supply and demand.  As the name implies precious metals are precious because their quantity is limited.  Because the quantity available is limited the demand is sometimes greater than the supply.  Its during those times that precious metals prices increase substantially.  

Most modern economists consider precious metals to be an insurance policy or hedge against inflation more than a traditional investment.  This is because the price of precious metals is tied closely to inflation.  As I mentioned preciously as inflation increases so to do mining and production costs, which lead to the asking price of the refined metal increasing in turn.  Like many long term investments a precious metals IRA has been shown to have less risk than some of the more traditional investments like stocks or ETF's.  It is because of these characteristics that Texas Bullion feels strongly about the long term benefits of owning precious metals.

The account executive knew my mother withdrew money from her account on  a frequent  basis to cover living and extraordinary expenses and that my mother would not have agreed to this investment had she known it would place her money off limits.

Furthermore there is the unethical aspect of such a longer term investment for an 80 year old person.

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak.

The general (non) consensus seems to be that oil prices will rise in the second half of 2017 before increasing further in 2018, or that they will remain low/static for that period.  

The arguments frequently used surround OPEC (2017 strategy, policy), UAE (strategy, policy), the kick in price of shale in North America and the global demand increases from China and India, as well as global peak demand not being achieved yet.

As such, if I was to take a 3-5 year view on oil, starting now, it would be safe to assume I'd get some sort of return...wouldn't I.

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",HES

[https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever!

0,1595339524.0,"I am 25 with $110K. No debt. 

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",HES

&#x200B;

I've been asked to finance a small cafè. I will be putting all the money to get the activity started, including works, machinery permits, etc... We are talking 20,000 USD more or less. My partner who found this opportunity will be the manager of the place (putting no money in at the beginning). He counts on having three employees running the place making his job just management activities that he will do while working another job.

He assigned himself a monthly salary for his job and 80% of the ownership of the cafe. I will be awarded a 20% of the cafe and will get revenues at the end of the year proportionally, about 10,000USD. Also the cafè will pay back my loan with a 6% interest rate in two years, generating 2000 dolalrs revenue.

Does this sound fair? I'm taking all the financia risk and if we go broke we will loose most of the investment as we are renting the place and the machinery is a small portion of the expense...

I would kindly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions,

He's not diversified even a little bit, and no amount of begging can persuade him to put some aside in case something goes wrong. He's all-in.

I have literally begged him to diversify with at least 3% to 5% of his money. That's such a tiny fraction of his wealth, it's almost forgettable. However, if something does indeed go wrong with his Bitcoin investments, a few it will be more than enough to either start fresh, or retire permanently to rest on his laurels. No amount of begging can sway him. He's convinced every cent should be in Bitcoin.

Although I swear this is about my ""friend"" Idiot, not about me, I'm actually in a similar circumstance. I am all-in with rare modern Chinese coins (MCC). They have been very profitable, and low risk. Not as impressive as Bitcoin profits, but still quite good, and the low risk part makes me feel very comfortable.

It's possible they have a squib warhead they could launch just to say they did, even though it won't perform as well as it would from a better design.

They figured it would be good for me to invest some money in retirement at a young age, and learn a bit about investments. I'm a financially frugal person, and have always wanted to own stocks, so this is really exciting for me in kind of a nerdy way.

2) What are my options for investing only 1.1k. I see a lot of vanguard options require a 3k minimum. 

3) Also, what kind of investments would you suggest? I am only investing a small amount, and i'm young, so would it be better to pick a high risk and highly volatile option? Or would a safer option, like the S&P 500 still give me and equally good return in the future?

Hi everyone, today we’re going to talk about 3 Stocks that have the potential to do more than 400%! I think they’re all really solid companies with a lot of momentum and they can go up a lot. For each company I’m going to give you a quick overview and news, if you want more info about price target and when and at what time I’m buying, you can watch the video! [https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq. It is a pharmaceutical company, focuses on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases. Its pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos and ACER-001, for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and osanetant for the treatment of induced Vasomotor Symptoms. The company has a research collaboration agreement with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to develop emetine hydrochloride as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19; and a license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to osanetant, a clinical-stage, selective, and non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. The stock has a moderate buy rating, with a price target of 10. This means that the company has an upside potential of more than 300%.This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.",INFO

The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",INFO

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq. It is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications. The stock right now has two candidates in it’s pipeline, galinpepimut-s and nelipepimut-s.

Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",KEY
0,1603793924.0,"I am invested in a small, privately owned startup company with a group of friends. This was an opportunity that became available as a result of a connection I made, and only required a small investment ($10k) that could potentially result in a 5-10x return over the years. 

The investor group is making a visit to the company and will have an audience with the CEO and several other key members of the organization.

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

    <ddhk> Hm, I think they'd only be able to successfully denoate maybe 1 nuke and even then it's only affect California and maybe some areas around it. Not the entire U.S.
    <ddhk> You'd need to denoate several nukes for that to happen
    <Amalynn> badon: Do they even have the technology to deliver such a strike?
    <badon> Amalynn: They say they do, but everyone else say they won't have for a few more months at least, because they need to do a nuclear test first. It's possible they have a squib warhead they could launch just to say they did, even though it won't perform as well as it would from a better design.
    <ddhk> yeah I think they can launch a missle that could possibley hit California and Alaska that's the last I read.
    <badon> ddhk: They would probably strike everyone if they can.
    <ddhk> I'm sure they'd like to but the don't have the ability to

I am 29 years old. I am autistic but HFA. I also suffer from Anxiety, Agoraphobia etc. 

Currently, the CDC states that there are 1 in 54 children somewhere on the spectrum. 

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave. If their set up wasn’t so difficult for people with ASD, SPD, Anxiety etc - think about how much more business they would get. 

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers. 

I also am a little worried posting here in case my full business plan (I have waaaaaay more research and things written up) is stolen and someone else runs with i.

Can anyone point me in the direction of how I would get investors. Like how does one go about walking up to a random person and ask for money?

For each company I’m going to cover 5 points: First a very quick company overview, second big news and so what is the next major catalyst. Of course remember that penny stock are a very high risk high reward investment so make sure to diversify your portfolio! If you want a more in depth analysis, with price targets and at what price you should buy the stock watch the youtube video! [https://youtu.be/A3ghS6ybxSs](https://youtu.be/A3ghS6ybxSs)

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

**Matinas BioPharma or MTNB on NYSE it’s a biopharmaceutical company .**By using its lipid nano-crystal platform (LNC) delivery technology, Matinas BioPharma hopes to solve complex challenges related to the oral delivery of small molecules, gene therapies, vaccines, proteins and peptides. Currently going for $1.36 a per share but  several members of the Street believe its share price presents an attractive entry point.The big catalyst right now is mat2203 , that in simple world is the first primary broad-spectrum treatment for immunocompromised patient. It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",LNC

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

0,1612989196.0,"Hi guys. I know this is boring but Ford has had some good momentum recently with new management and relatively low cost. Zack’s had it as Buy (#1) at the beginning of this week and it is rated a Buy by almost all analysts. Most recent forecast is at $14 (it is currently trading under $12).  

Here is my thought - I think Ford has to become cool or it will slowly die and their new CEO knows it. There is nothing special about the company now and price is showing it. So unlike other car companies that can play it safe, Ford has to take radical steps and reinvent itself.

Hi everyone, today we’re going to talk about 3 Stocks that have the potential to do more than 400%! I think they’re all really solid companies with a lot of momentum and they can go up a lot. For each company I’m going to give you a quick overview and news, if you want more info about price target and when and at what time I’m buying, you can watch the video! [https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq. It is a pharmaceutical company, focuses on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases. Its pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos and ACER-001, for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and osanetant for the treatment of induced Vasomotor Symptoms. The company has a research collaboration agreement with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to develop emetine hydrochloride as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19; and a license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to osanetant, a clinical-stage, selective, and non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. The stock has a moderate buy rating, with a price target of 10. This means that the company has an upside potential of more than 300%.This company has a lot of catalyst, right now it’s product are all in clinical stages, but once they good news such as the fact that they’re ready for commercialization the stock could go up a lot.",LOW

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",LOW

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

0,1609614337.0,"Hi everyone, today I wanted to talk about 6 penny stocks I’ve found that could potentially double or even triple their value very soon. For each company I’m going to cover 5 points: First a very quick company overview, second big news and so what is the next major catalyst. Of course remember that penny stock are a very high risk high reward investment so make sure to diversify your portfolio! If you want a more in depth analysis, with price targets and at what price you should buy the stock watch the youtube video! [https://youtu.be/A3ghS6ybxSs](https://youtu.be/A3ghS6ybxSs)

&#x200B;

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

**Matinas BioPharma or MTNB on NYSE it’s a biopharmaceutical company .**By using its lipid nano-crystal platform (LNC) delivery technology, Matinas BioPharma hopes to solve complex challenges related to the oral delivery of small molecules, gene therapies, vaccines, proteins and peptides. Currently going for $1.36 a per share but  several members of the Street believe its share price presents an attractive entry point.The big catalyst right now is mat2203 , that in simple world is the first primary broad-spectrum treatment for immunocompromised patient. It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",LOW

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

However, as you get to know markets, you want to capture more gains when the market soars up and focus on growth-oriented assets. Going with growth stocks like Amazon and Netflix are great, as is investing in ETFs and REITs.

This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025.

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",MET

Hi everyone, today I wanted to talk about 5 penny stocks that costs arround 2 or 3 dollars, one even 13 cents  and have very high potential to double or even triple they’re value. If you want more information watch the video! [https://youtu.be/V-YbpVzM0a8](https://youtu.be/V-YbpVzM0a8)

The first stock is colorstar technology or cscw on Nasdaq. through its subsidiaries, provides online and offline music education services in the United States throught CACM Group NY and China. It also offers Color World, an online cultural entertainment platform that provides celebrity lectures, celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, and artist interactive communication.. Color World App offers both a Chinese version, which launched on September 10, 2020 and an international version, to be launched by the end of 2020. Since its launch in less than three months ago, the Chinese version has already attracted over 600,000 registered users and over 50 celebrity coaches. The revenue is set to grow a lot in the next years, doubling from 2021 to 2022 and to grow even more in the following years. 

Next stock is gevo incorporation or gevo on Nasdaq. It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Shares climbed this week after the [alternative fuel](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/) specialist announced that it had exercised an option to purchase 239 acres of land in South Dakota, capitalizing on an expansion opportunity. It also said it had met the first milestone in its $1.5 billion contract with Trafigura, a commodities trading company, to secure control of a site by the end of the year. In August, the company signed the deal -- the biggest contract in its history -- to provide Trafigura with 25 million gallons per year in fuel, most of which will be renewable gasoline. 

Than we have artificial intelligence or aitx on over the country markets. It is a holding company, and it’s subsidiaries are all companies in the robotic and Artificial intelligence sector. This week the holding announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) has received an order from a large construction company for what RAD expects as the first of many [ROSA](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Froboticassistancedevices.com%2Frosa%2F&esheet=52329709&newsitemid=20201117005699&lan=en-US&anchor=ROSA&index=1&md5=41d294732eff6f7048b61b36205eb744)unit , is a self-contained, artificial intelligence to be deployed at the client’s managed properties across the United States. And also a lot recently commented that their overall sales funnel continues to accelerate and it is foreseeable that the Q3 ending sales plus contracts number may exceed the 133% growth noted in a prior press release. And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money. The revenue of the company has grown a lot, going from 14 million in 2018, to 28 in 2019 and 24 in 2020, but without q4, so it is expected to be over 30 million. This growth rate is pretty good, considering that they’re also cutting a lot the cost of the revenue! 

**Last we have MIND Technology**, **Inc**. provides **technology** and solutions for exploration, survey, and defense applications in oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic, and security industries. The **Company** designs, manufactures, and sells specialized, high performance sonar and seismic equipment. The balance shit for the company is improving year by year, as you can see from the graph the debt is going down and the cash flow it’s kinda improving in the long term, but of course it took a big hit in 2020. This company is a bit riskier than the other ones",MET

Hi everyone Today I’m going to talk about 6 stocks: greenpro capital, ocugen , Peabody energy, ideanomics, phunware and bionano genomics. I’m going to analyze them quickly and give you my thoughts. If you want more details watch the video! [https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0](https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0)

The first stock is greenpro capital or grnq. with strategic offices across Asia, is a business incubator with a diversified business portfolio comprising finance, technology, banking, CryptoSx for STOs. With 30 years of experience in various industries, Greenpro has been assisting and supporting businesses and High-Net-Worth-Individuals to capitalize and securitize their value on a global scale through the provision of cross-border business solutions and spinoffs on major stock exchanges. Today it announced that its incubator company, Global Leaders Corporation ""GLC"" has filed a registration statement to be listed on US stock exchange! It is a company with a focus on start-up advisory and corporate consulting services, targeting start-up companies and young entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region.  

The second stock is ocugen or OCGN on Nasdaq. Ocugen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative therapies to treat blindness diseases. Ocugen announced binding letter of an intent with bharat biotech for co-development of Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the U.S. market, earlier this morning. this COVID collaboration could be a significant source of non-dilutive funding and potential revenue for the company, which now has the opportunity to work alongside a company that has had success in the space. 

Next stock is Ideanomics or IDEX on Nasdaq. It operates as a financial technology company. The Company focuses on facilitating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles and developing next-generation financial services and Fintech products. Today it announced that it has signed a deal for the purchase of 2,000 EVs for ride-hailing services and deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of next year. The company is currently investing in electric vehicles and EV battery sales as well as the blockchain industry, that in my opinion will be very important trend in the future. 

Next we have bionano genomics or bngo on Nasdaq! The company provides a platform to analyze the long segments of genomic DNA and other biomolecules structural variations and has highlighted the results of a recently published preprint study demonstrating the superiority of its optical mapping technology for detecting large structural variations and also as you can see here there are a lot of very good news about this company. 

is Peabody energy or BTU on Nasdaq! is the largest private sector coal company in the world. Its primary business consists of the mining, sale, and distribution of coal, which is purchased for use in electricity generation and steelmaking. Shares of several oil companies are trading higher as oil prices rise following an attack on two Iraqi wells. The start of the vaccine rollout has also lifted demand outlook. 

Last we have Phunware or Phun on Nasdaq. It is the pioneer of Multiscreen-as-a-Service (MaaS), an award winning, fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile that provides companies the products, solutions, data and services necessary to engage, manage and monetize their mobile application portfolios and audiences globally at scale. today the company announced its receipt of the Privacy Shield certification.

0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",TAP

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

0,1613548733.0,"Hey guys. So I am a total newb here and have just learned that my grandfather, 20 years ago (29 years old now), made a Mutual Funds Account for me. He invested 15,000 dollars into it. It was invested as such:

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",ORLY

[https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw](https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw)

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform. So in my opinion once they announce good news, the stock will probably go up a lot.",ORLY

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",ORLY

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

\- STABILITY: the company will not collapse and takes away my stocks. (the more stable the better, based on news)

Thank you very much for help in advanced. ;)",ORLY

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",ORLY

0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",ORLY

This penny stock cost respectively and have a very high potential to double or even triple their value in the short term and to do even more in the long term. For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",ORLY

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

Currently going for $1.36 a per share but  several members of the Street believe its share price presents an attractive entry point.The big catalyst right now is mat2203 , that in simple world is the first primary broad-spectrum treatment for immunocompromised patient. It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",ORLY

Next stock is gevo incorporation or gevo on Nasdaq. It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Shares climbed this week after the [alternative fuel](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/) specialist announced that it had exercised an option to purchase 239 acres of land in South Dakota, capitalizing on an expansion opportunity.

In August, the company signed the deal -- the biggest contract in its history -- to provide Trafigura with 25 million gallons per year in fuel, most of which will be renewable gasoline. 

Than we have artificial intelligence or aitx on over the country markets. It is a holding company, and it’s subsidiaries are all companies in the robotic and Artificial intelligence sector.

Hi everyone Today I’m going to talk about 6 stocks: greenpro capital, ocugen , Peabody energy, ideanomics, phunware and bionano genomics. I’m going to analyze them quickly and give you my thoughts.

I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

I am 29 years old. I am autistic but HFA. I also suffer from Anxiety, Agoraphobia etc. 

Currently, the CDC states that there are 1 in 54 children somewhere on the spectrum. 

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave. If their set up wasn’t so difficult for people with ASD, SPD, Anxiety etc - think about how much more business they would get. 

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers. 

I also am a little worried posting here in case my full business plan (I have waaaaaay more research and things written up) is stolen and someone else runs with i.

Can anyone point me in the direction of how I would get investors. Like how does one go about walking up to a random person and ask for money?

My question is this....

Should I take the 2500 and pay off credit card debt, effectively making my revolving debt zero.... Or should I continue paying on the two cards and invest the 2500.

One card has no interest, and the other is at a ridiculous percentage that I could never equal in the stock market.

My idea is to pay off the interest bearing card, invest the balance on the market, continue paying off the other card within the next couple months, and reap the rewards of the investment.

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",ORLY

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

&#x200B;

I've been asked to finance a small cafè. I will be putting all the money to get the activity started, including works, machinery permits, etc... We are talking 20,000 USD more or less. My partner who found this opportunity will be the manager of the place (putting no money in at the beginning). He counts on having three employees running the place making his job just management activities that he will do while working another job.

He assigned himself a monthly salary for his job and 80% of the ownership of the cafe. I will be awarded a 20% of the cafe and will get revenues at the end of the year proportionally, about 10,000USD. Also the cafè will pay back my loan with a 6% interest rate in two years, generating 2000 dolalrs revenue.

Does this sound fair? I'm taking all the financia risk and if we go broke we will loose most of the investment as we are renting the place and the machinery is a small portion of the expense...

I would kindly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions,

Thanks!",ORLY

The rest I would like to invest in mutual funds, bonds, annuities.  I'm also thinking about purchasing a second home.  I can pay cash or take out a mortgage.

I’m using HL as an investment platform. Qs are 

1. I was thinking that it’s too skewed on bonds - thoughts?
2. I was thinking about swapping one of the bond funds for a healthcare fund - thoughts? Additionally, something that would give me a huge exposure to Africa cheaply.
3. So far, every fund is to be weighted at 12.5% - should i focus on some sectors more or less?
4. I’m thinking about using LISA as a wrapper but I’m not sure that with LISA I’ll be able to buy a house so it’s more of a retirement savings. 
5. So far, I’m putting money into normal ISA. 

I can safely put away 4-5k a year, so what I want is constant growth so that at ‘later age’ (i’m 28 now) i’ll have a stable income. I don’t think I’m very willing to wait till I'm 60, I'll hopefully increase my income so I can increase my contributions and retire (FIRE?) early.

0,1542674346.0,"Media pictures Millennials as a generation that lacks financial knowledge and capital to start investing. As a Millennial myself, I am not sure if these are completely accurate statements. Because most of my friends have some sort of financial literacy and they actually think and take actions towards their financial futures. They normally use apps such as [https://robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com/), [acorns.com](http://acorns.com/), [stashinvest.com](http://stashinvest.com/) to invest their money. 

I’ve tried most of them before but I am sticking with one of them as of now. Every month I allocate some portion of my income towards investing so that I can have a peace of mind about my future. I’ve been investing for a few years now and it became a habit to put away some of my money every month. It really helps me to build up my savings and wealth. 

Recently I came across a tool that lets people invest in the world's most valuable paintings [https://www.masterworks.io/](https://www.masterworks.io/). I’ve put some money in it as I was attracted to the whole idea of it and the investment returns that they mention on their website. On average the return on paintings outperformed the S&P 500 by 250% since the year 2000 with low degrees of volatility. Sounds too good to be true but I gave it a shot and we’ll see how it goes. By any chance if you’ve tried them before or use them now, can you share your experiences with them? I am thinking to add more money if they can build up trust with me and provide good performance on my investments.  ",ORLY

If you look at [this image](https://imgur.com/yuHKda4) there is a spike at just after 12:00 on 30 November. Is this a single trade that went through at a much higher price? Why would this happen?

Or is it just based on buy/sell offers that are made, not necessarily being executed? (surely this would open up some pretty heavy manipulation?)

0,1516446017.0,"> If I invest in your company I will pay for the company's losses, but since there are no dividends, I will not be paid for the company's profits. How is this different from simply giving you my money for free, with nothing in return? 

I posted the above question, here:

* https://www.startengine.com/brightlocker

I found [Brightlocker](https://www.brightlocker.com/) via these subreddits:

* /r/GameDeals
* /r/GameDealsFree
* /r/FreeGameFindings

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

So, basically I'm looking an investment that seems risky to me, but adding the fact there will be no dividends (and investors can't vote), and I'm struggling to understand how anyone can see this as a smart thing to invest in.",ORLY
0,1506789831.0,"The news is full of anti-gold articles. I believe that means someone powerful is buying. Who? People who have the ability to dictate to media outlets what kinds of things they talk about. It probably isn't any one group or person behind this. Instead, it's more likely just a lot of people who have noticed the direction the world economy is moving in, so they try mask their buying by pushing prices down. 

Big buyers can easily cause market distortion and unsustainable price gains that will collapse after they stop buying. To prevent that, they use their influence to put negative news in the media about whatever it is they're buying. That pushes away a certain about of investment each day, so The Powers That Be can make those investments themselves while either sustaining prices or causing them to drop.

After they're done buying, or when the world markets reach a point where the prices can't be suppressed anymore, prices rise and quick profits are earned. Rinse and repeat.

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy. 

Remember this is my opinion. This is not bound to happen and if you don't agree with that, that's fine. I am long on shares of AAPL, BABA, PFE and NIO.",PFE

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

Hi everyone, today we’re going to talk about 3 Stocks that have the potential to do more than 400%! I think they’re all really solid companies with a lot of momentum and they can go up a lot. For each company I’m going to give you a quick overview and news, if you want more info about price target and when and at what time I’m buying, you can watch the video! [https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq.

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",SEE

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities.

That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs.

The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States.

According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",SEE

Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",SEE
0,1606759110.0,"Hi All,

I recently hit a milestone in my high-yield savings account ($75k) and now I am looking to set up bi-weekly investments into ETFs. I plan on using my capital to invest in residential multi-family real estate deals in the future so I’m just looking to make some extra earnings on my capital moving forward.

I’m looking at investing in SPY (50%), ICLN (20%), and VGT (30%) on a bi-weekly basis. Does anyone have other ETF suggestions? My plan is to make bi-weekly investments (~$2,500/month) and be able to cash out of these investments (if needed) in 1-5 years for real estate deals, wedding, etc.

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy. 

Remember this is my opinion. This is not bound to happen and if you don't agree with that, that's fine. I am long on shares of AAPL, BABA, PFE and NIO.",SEE
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",SEE

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money. The revenue of the company has grown a lot, going from 14 million in 2018, to 28 in 2019 and 24 in 2020, but without q4, so it is expected to be over 30 million. This growth rate is pretty good, considering that they’re also cutting a lot the cost of the revenue! 

**Last we have MIND Technology**, **Inc**. provides **technology** and solutions for exploration, survey, and defense applications in oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic, and security industries. The **Company** designs, manufactures, and sells specialized, high performance sonar and seismic equipment. The balance shit for the company is improving year by year, as you can see from the graph the debt is going down and the cash flow it’s kinda improving in the long term, but of course it took a big hit in 2020.

For each company I’m going to cover 5 points: First a very quick company overview, second big news and so what is the next major catalyst. Of course remember that penny stock are a very high risk high reward investment so make sure to diversify your portfolio! If you want a more in depth analysis, with price targets and at what price you should buy the stock watch the youtube video! [https://youtu.be/A3ghS6ybxSs](https://youtu.be/A3ghS6ybxSs)

&#x200B;

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

**Matinas BioPharma or MTNB on NYSE it’s a biopharmaceutical company .**By using its lipid nano-crystal platform (LNC) delivery technology, Matinas BioPharma hopes to solve complex challenges related to the oral delivery of small molecules, gene therapies, vaccines, proteins and peptides. Currently going for $1.36 a per share but  several members of the Street believe its share price presents an attractive entry point.The big catalyst right now is mat2203 , that in simple world is the first primary broad-spectrum treatment for immunocompromised patient. It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",SEE

Hi everyone Today I’m going to talk about 6 stocks: greenpro capital, ocugen , Peabody energy, ideanomics, phunware and bionano genomics. I’m going to analyze them quickly and give you my thoughts. If you want more details watch the video! [https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0](https://youtu.be/gb6zw91YXO0)

The first stock is greenpro capital or grnq. with strategic offices across Asia, is a business incubator with a diversified business portfolio comprising finance, technology, banking, CryptoSx for STOs. With 30 years of experience in various industries, Greenpro has been assisting and supporting businesses and High-Net-Worth-Individuals to capitalize and securitize their value on a global scale through the provision of cross-border business solutions and spinoffs on major stock exchanges. Today it announced that its incubator company, Global Leaders Corporation ""GLC"" has filed a registration statement to be listed on US stock exchange! It is a company with a focus on start-up advisory and corporate consulting services, targeting start-up companies and young entrepreneurs in the Asia-Pacific Region.  

The second stock is ocugen or OCGN on Nasdaq. Ocugen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative therapies to treat blindness diseases. Ocugen announced binding letter of an intent with bharat biotech for co-development of Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the U.S. market, earlier this morning. this COVID collaboration could be a significant source of non-dilutive funding and potential revenue for the company, which now has the opportunity to work alongside a company that has had success in the space. 

Next stock is Ideanomics or IDEX on Nasdaq. It operates as a financial technology company. The Company focuses on facilitating the adoption of commercial electric vehicles and developing next-generation financial services and Fintech products. Today it announced that it has signed a deal for the purchase of 2,000 EVs for ride-hailing services and deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of next year. The company is currently investing in electric vehicles and EV battery sales as well as the blockchain industry, that in my opinion will be very important trend in the future. 

Next we have bionano genomics or bngo on Nasdaq! The company provides a platform to analyze the long segments of genomic DNA and other biomolecules structural variations and has highlighted the results of a recently published preprint study demonstrating the superiority of its optical mapping technology for detecting large structural variations and also as you can see here there are a lot of very good news about this company. 

is Peabody energy or BTU on Nasdaq! is the largest private sector coal company in the world. Its primary business consists of the mining, sale, and distribution of coal, which is purchased for use in electricity generation and steelmaking. Shares of several oil companies are trading higher as oil prices rise following an attack on two Iraqi wells. The start of the vaccine rollout has also lifted demand outlook. 

Last we have Phunware or Phun on Nasdaq. It is the pioneer of Multiscreen-as-a-Service (MaaS), an award winning, fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile that provides companies the products, solutions, data and services necessary to engage, manage and monetize their mobile application portfolios and audiences globally at scale. today the company announced its receipt of the Privacy Shield certification.

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",SEE

However, as you get to know markets, you want to capture more gains when the market soars up and focus on growth-oriented assets. Going with growth stocks like Amazon and Netflix are great, as is investing in ETFs and REITs.

I discussed it with a few other people when I [chat in ##business+investing and ##gaming on Freenode](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net:+6697/##prepping,#coins,##gaming,##business+investing), and I would like to know what /r/Investments has to say about it. This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

My parents both work in finance and they were explaining to me that if I invest $1.1k in a traditional IRA then I won't end up owing any federal taxes. They figured it would be good for me to invest some money in retirement at a young age, and learn a bit about investments. I'm a financially frugal person, and have always wanted to own stocks, so this is really exciting for me in kind of a nerdy way.

My dad told me to open a traditional IRA through Vanguard (not a roth IRA). He said I can pick from any number of investments, and that I should do my research and find one I like.

I have three questions:

&nbsp;

1) Can I open my IRA by investing in an ETF? Based on a little research i did, i like the Vanguard Health Care ETF as a high risk option, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF as a less risky option. 

2) What are my options for investing only 1.1k. I see a lot of vanguard options require a 3k minimum. 

3) Also, what kind of investments would you suggest? I am only investing a small amount, and i'm young, so would it be better to pick a high risk and highly volatile option? Or would a safer option, like the S&P 500 still give me and equally good return in the future?

# The penny stock is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**
* **Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.**
* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.** 

**Next company is Genetic Technologies Limited ticker symbol on nasdaq GENE), it**  **is a diversified molecular diagnostics company. Today the company was up 30% and that’s because they provided some very good updates to the market on further development on the COVID-19 serious disease risk Polygenic Risk Score Test (COVID-19 PRS Test) and expansion of the Company’s offering to include Germline Testing division.**

Here is a list of stocks to consider entering now. Remember to make your due diligence always:

1. AAPL: Strong projection of record highs sales volume this Christmas. Plenty of consensus from different analysts that the company will reach the price target of 145usd. 
2. BABA: This stock is extremely undervalued in terms of earnings in comparison with the whole industry ratios. Suffered some losses lately due to some minor setbacks. Price target of 300usd. 
3. PFE: Even though the company has some issues related to its debt, the vaccine needs to be stone cold to be effective and has a current mediocre chart. If you see the earnings and the price for each Q. It's plausible the stock is trading at a discount and could have great potential once earning are released. Price target of 45usd. 
4. XOM: The company has suffered a lot due to the pandemic, with vaccines rolling in, cashflow will start to get backup. Price target of 53usd.
5. NIO: Company with huge potentials due to the highly profitable business model: Batteries + Charging Station + Cars manufacturing + Self-driving capabilities. Also remember this company is held in china 1.3 billion people as potential customers and in a country with a deep need to go green as pollution is at an all time high. Price target of 80 usd.

As many of you pointed out, PLTR is an excellent company, and as many of you pointed out industry earnings are not something to be taken too seriously in some sectors, but I also guide myself on research. See the latest Credit suise price tag of the stock. Is in desperate need of a positive catalyst to keep gains coming and it can be a long time until demo day next month. Although if you consider by your research that this is going to the moon, then 2,3% portfolio position can be a possible strategy. 

Remember this is my opinion. This is not bound to happen and if you don't agree with that, that's fine. I am long on shares of AAPL, BABA, PFE and NIO.",NOW
0,1610053600.0,"Hi everyone Today I’m going to cover 4 penny stocks that are: 9 meter biopharma, orchad therapeutics and Sundial growers. This penny stock cost respectively and have a very high potential to double or even triple their value in the short term and to do even more in the long term. For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",NOW

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy.

Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",NOW

0,1612185529.0,"Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make matters worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

0,1613548733.0,"Hey guys. So I am a total newb here and have just learned that my grandfather, 20 years ago (29 years old now), made a Mutual Funds Account for me. He invested 15,000 dollars into it. It was invested as such:

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin.

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market.

The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States.

According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing.

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned.

So many people chase the latest pop or hype and some make money while most lose, become disenchanted with investing, and wail to the gods WHY did this f\*\*\*\*ing stock go down on positive news...(PFE)

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",NOW

Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",NOW

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",NOW
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",NOW

I’m using HL as an investment platform. Qs are 

1. I was thinking that it’s too skewed on bonds - thoughts?
2. I was thinking about swapping one of the bond funds for a healthcare fund - thoughts? Additionally, something that would give me a huge exposure to Africa cheaply.
3. So far, every fund is to be weighted at 12.5% - should i focus on some sectors more or less?
4. I’m thinking about using LISA as a wrapper but I’m not sure that with LISA I’ll be able to buy a house so it’s more of a retirement savings. 
5. So far, I’m putting money into normal ISA. 

I can safely put away 4-5k a year, so what I want is constant growth so that at ‘later age’ (i’m 28 now) i’ll have a stable income. I don’t think I’m very willing to wait till I'm 60, I'll hopefully increase my income so I can increase my contributions and retire (FIRE?) early.

0,1570631073.0,"My wife and I have a nest egg that we had put into two index funds, one slightly more and one slightly less aggressive, which we (probably foolishly) pulled out of the market about a year ago. Our thinking at the time was that we intend to use the money for a down payment on a house and were concerned that market volatility might give it a real whack just when the timing was wrong for us. 

Of course, the last 12 months have seen strong growth in the market, so we're now wondering if we should get back in for the next year, because we probably won't be looking to buy in that period and could potentially pocket some decent gains (they sure would have been this year). 

What I'm asking is what the most rational decision is at this point. Should we:

a) Get back in with all of it, because the market is not going to have a big huge drop in the next 18 months, splitting between our conservative and aggressive funds again

b) Get back in with some of it, because that way we don't totally miss out on any growth but also don't lose our shirts if things go south

c) Stay out completely, because we don't *need* growth in order for our nest egg to work for us, it would just be nice, and if the market pulls a 2008, the nest egg actually will no longer serve the purpose for which it is intended.

0,1613548733.0,"Hey guys. So I am a total newb here and have just learned that my grandfather, 20 years ago (29 years old now), made a Mutual Funds Account for me. He invested 15,000 dollars into it. It was invested as such:

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

As of right now, the account has closed and I will receive the money soon. Again, it started as $15000, and now is about $62,500. 

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

Hi everyone, today we’re going to talk about 3 Stocks that have the potential to do more than 400%! I think they’re all really solid companies with a lot of momentum and they can go up a lot. For each company I’m going to give you a quick overview and news, if you want more info about price target and when and at what time I’m buying, you can watch the video! [https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q](https://youtu.be/JuZ9EZFIf4Q)

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! A

# Third stock is is acer therapeutics ticker symbol acer on Nasdaq.

I was looking at short term-long term CDS but apparently interest rates are so low there are savings accounts that pay more interest than CDS right now. Are there other investment options I should be looking at? Some of it we need to be liquid because we will be buying a new car (new to us-used so around 10k?)

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future.

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq.

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,.

This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform.

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",SO

Hi Everyone :D

I am looking for help in the following:

\- SOFTWARE: I am looking for a web platform (or mobile app not necessary but a plus).

\- TO DO: Where I can buy stocks from especially USA publicly traded companies (A.) Other publicly traded companies globally, B.) penny stocks, C.) crypto currency, D.) rare earth material are a plus but not necessary) 

\- TO DO: I am interested to buy parts of a stocks when 1 stock is too large in value like 2000 USD so I can just by a smaller % of a stock

\- AVILABILITY: The service is available from the European Union with EU bank account/debit card

\- CURRENCIES: I can put in different main currencies other than USD especially.: EUR, GBP. 

\- QUESTION REGARDING CURRENCY EXCHANGE: Here I am not sure a bit. If I buy USA stocks than is I definitely need to pay in USD so if I would pay in EUR than that would be converted every time or I just load in my money to the trading platform in USD than I just trade in USD?

\- COMPLIANCE: The company should not block me form buying anything like Robinhood blocked its users to make purchases

\- COMPLIANCE: The company not gives out my data like personal data and purchases history to big investment firms.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Platform that has good cyber security so it has low chance that hackers steel my stocks or banking information, identity. Here it can be measured by previous data breaches.

\- CYBER SECURITY: Possibly 2 factor authentications so people can't steel my stocks

\- PRICEING: I am happy even to pay a monthly fee of like 10USD/month

\- PRICEING: Platforms that take commission is fine until that is not exceeds something like 20 USD/month / 1000 USD investment if I don’t do day trading but just keep that money in 5-10 stocks (I am not interested in day trading, more like midterm investment).

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: There should not be anything like that the trading platform gives me extra money to invest and when I spend my money and buy a stock there are no backstabbing as follows: that if the stocks drop its price prom the original purchase price 1st my money starts disappearing and then the trading platforms money that the training platform have given to me than I when own to the platform money. I just want to use my own money from my own bank account. 

\- NO WIERD SAFF LIKE THIS: selling my personal data like some trading apps to investment firms algorithms so they can bet against me and normal humans.

\- NO BACKSTABING: So, a platform that don’t stabs me in the back with 1000-page contract than skims me in any ways that I am not being aware of. I want clear cut rules that I pay x for them and I can keep my stocks in a good place.

\- STABILITY: the company will not collapse and takes away my stocks. (the more stable the better, based on news)

Thank you very much for help in advanced. ;)",SO

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So there are many types of ways to trade and invest and I'm just sharing mine. My current long-term holdings are: T, XOM, VZ, MO, PFE, F, GE, HSY, COST, and WMT. I have become familiar with their movements over the years and while anything can happen, I feel confident in my particular choices.

It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. Before going into the strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* **Eliminated slightly over C$220M from their balance      sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up      cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue      strategic investments instead.**
* **Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.**
* **Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding      debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based      royalties from Zenabis.**
* **Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88      per gram.**

**As far as the price target, I’ve seen many analysis, the best one seems this one, that is an article from seekingalpha.com,**  **Where they valued the share at about 1.34, so a 100% from now.** 

**Next company is Genetic Technologies Limited ticker symbol on nasdaq GENE), it**  **is a diversified molecular diagnostics company. Today the company was up 30% and that’s because they provided some very good updates to the market on further development on the COVID-19 serious disease risk Polygenic Risk Score Test (COVID-19 PRS Test) and expansion of the Company’s offering to include Germline Testing division.** 

· **Total COVID-19 positive patient data analyzed exceeds 5,500 following inclusion of further 4,000 patients’ data**  
 **º Predictive capabilities improved 100% over age and sex alone1**  
 **º Analysis confirms that the test is well calibrated2**  
 **º Further datasets will continue to enhance the accuracy and consistency of the algorithm**

My only option is to sell the warrant, but is fluctuating.  The more the stock goes up, the more my dashboard says I'm making money, but if I'm buying the stock, shouldn't I want it to hit less so that when I sell it I make more?

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",SO
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",SO
0,1606759110.0,"Hi All,

I recently hit a milestone in my high-yield savings account ($75k) and now I am looking to set up bi-weekly investments into ETFs. I plan on using my capital to invest in residential multi-family real estate deals in the future so I’m just looking to make some extra earnings on my capital moving forward.

I’m looking at investing in SPY (50%), ICLN (20%), and VGT (30%) on a bi-weekly basis. Does anyone have other ETF suggestions? My plan is to make bi-weekly investments (~$2,500/month) and be able to cash out of these investments (if needed) in 1-5 years for real estate deals, wedding, etc.

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",SO

I'm new to investing and looking for some advice/ideas. I'm living in Europe and plan to stay here with a goal of buying a house in the future. 

I currently have only about  € 2,500   \~ € 3,000 and can put aside around € 100 \~ € 200 every month.

I've looked at some things like the robo advisor ETFmatic and P2P lending app called Mintos and Tesla stocks for example. I don't know how viable it is to invest in the S&P 500 from Europe.

I've seen a lot of people also using Degiro as their broker.

I already know about plenty of books and Bogleheads so really just looking for ideas to explore further. :) 

Any advice is welcome on how and where to start !",SO
0,1607353165.0,"okay so please don't shoot me, but here's how i'm looking at it.. 

so we know that banks operate by taking your money and lending it to someone else, the more money they have on their book, the more they can lend out and the more they can spend on expanding their influence and quality of service

whether or not a customer decides to deposit their savings, apply for a mortgage, get a credit card, use their investment platform, etc etc, is based on the the value/cost proposition and the human element. Do i like this bank? Do i trust this bank? Does Kelly Bobson treat me like a human being and help me with my financial planning?

the better relationships a bank can offer without making their clients feel like they're being taken advantage of, or come through in niche deals and financing of small business, the better.. their deposits grow and so does their influence


now typically, share price is an indicator of the health and belief in the future potential of the company, if you're rated high banks are more likely to give you loans and other business partners are more likley to deal with you

but why would banks care for this? Wouldn't their assets/book value, client base and all the various 3rd party NPS reviews and all that good stuff be sufficient?

why deal with having public shares, dividends, and making business decisions under the slogan of ""pleasing the shareholders"" when the shareholders are effectively the clients who benefit from a reliable bank that isn't screwing them over

again i'm not trying to sway or prove a point, this is merely how i see it and would like to hear what piece i'm missing in this particular scenario?",SO

For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever!

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy.

Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",SO

And also a lot recently commented that their overall sales funnel continues to accelerate and it is foreseeable that the Q3 ending sales plus contracts number may exceed the 133% growth noted in a prior press release. And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money. The revenue of the company has grown a lot, going from 14 million in 2018, to 28 in 2019 and 24 in 2020, but without q4, so it is expected to be over 30 million. This growth rate is pretty good, considering that they’re also cutting a lot the cost of the revenue! 

**Last we have MIND Technology**, **Inc**. provides **technology** and solutions for exploration, survey, and defense applications in oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic, and security industries. The **Company** designs, manufactures, and sells specialized, high performance sonar and seismic equipment. The balance shit for the company is improving year by year, as you can see from the graph the debt is going down and the cash flow it’s kinda improving in the long term, but of course it took a big hit in 2020. This company is a bit riskier than the other ones",SO

I'm not looking to make millions, just some some steady monthly/quarterly incomes in terms of like...few hundred dollars. I'm from Romania, we don't have so big paychecks, the medium salary is about 800 USD / per month. In my country, it is quite hard to earn and have a good living if you are a simple employee and the government is not really helping new businesses, so I'm trying to find a way to raise my monthly income. For the past 7 months i've been reasearching about shares and things to invest my money in, but in the end, my conclusion is that without consistent investments, the winnings are really, really low.  So, what I'm asking is, what would you do if you had $1000 to invest and you were able to add about $200 more each month to it? In this way, is it even possible to have a steady monthly income of a few hundred dollars after a 1-2 years?

I really appreciate your views. Please take into account that investment possibilities here in this forgotten country are quite small, though I can access shares in the US markets.",SO

The plan would be to use it strictly for camping and disconnecting from the crazy world, and possibly later building a small off the grid cabin on.

0,1595339524.0,"I am 25 with $110K. No debt. 

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

I'm a student passionate about technological innovation. A year ago I started putting some pocket money into tech stocks I believed in. I basically had a purchasing spree last October and one in March. So most of my positions are \~6 months old, some are almost 11.

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

Basically, I am an expert (not formally just first hand account of living through it) on sensory issues. Even neuro typical children have meltdowns in stores. 

Why? 

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

Have you noticed how Target is much more pleasant than Walmart just based on lighting alone? 

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave. If their set up wasn’t so difficult for people with ASD, SPD, Anxiety etc - think about how much more business they would get. 

Not sure if this idea has any legs or not. I wouldn’t just focus on big box retailers.

What I'm asking is what the most rational decision is at this point. Should we:

a) Get back in with all of it, because the market is not going to have a big huge drop in the next 18 months, splitting between our conservative and aggressive funds again

b) Get back in with some of it, because that way we don't totally miss out on any growth but also don't lose our shirts if things go south

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

I’m using HL as an investment platform. Qs are 

1. I was thinking that it’s too skewed on bonds - thoughts?
2. I was thinking about swapping one of the bond funds for a healthcare fund - thoughts? Additionally, something that would give me a huge exposure to Africa cheaply.
3. So far, every fund is to be weighted at 12.5% - should i focus on some sectors more or less?
4. I’m thinking about using LISA as a wrapper but I’m not sure that with LISA I’ll be able to buy a house so it’s more of a retirement savings. 
5. So far, I’m putting money into normal ISA. 

I can safely put away 4-5k a year, so what I want is constant growth so that at ‘later age’ (i’m 28 now) i’ll have a stable income. I don’t think I’m very willing to wait till I'm 60, I'll hopefully increase my income so I can increase my contributions and retire (FIRE?) early.

This question is the reason I don't invest in most stocks anymore. I feel like I'm buying premium-priced fiat that's worse than paper money, with less liquidity, and much higher inflation. 

I'm not trolling Brightlocker, though. I am sincerely interested in this company because its marketing has been effective enough to get my attention, and a lot other people's attention. They claim the only reason they're seeking investment funding now is because they are experiencing a sudden vertical spike in growth. Considering all the attention they're getting from reddit right now, I believe them. 

However, most of the attention is coming from game giveaways, and I'm skeptical they can maintain high growth, especially without reddit's help. In other words, I suspect this might be a temporarily successful marketing campaign that may or may not be repeatable without exhausting reddit's attention span. Reddit can be fickle like that, and investing in this company now might be disappointing, after the current marketing campaign winds down.

This would be the list of the stocks to avoid at the moment in my opinion, some of you might not agree with this and that's fine:

2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.

25% of $15000 into American Funds

25% of $15000 into American Balance Fund

25% of $15000 into Income Funds of America

25% of $15000 into Fundamental Investors American Funds.

&#x200B;

Basically, as of yesterday, I learned as a technicality due to my age I must close the account, and also had a spreadsheet given to me of my percentage growth per yer year of the Fund.

&#x200B;

It has had dips and increases, but ultimately, ended up having an average growth of 7.5 % yearly.

&#x200B;

Now my financial advisor (who is the guy my father has been working with to manage this stuff), told me that over the 20 years he has managed this Mutual Funds Account, it is good that it has grown by about 7.5% yearly, however he says he could reinvest my money into a similarly, roughly conservative option/options, where it should grow anywhere from 9 to 10% yearly.

&#x200B;

I would Love to put it into an account like it was in before, or the one my financial advisor says he can now put it into (where he says I can expect 9-10% yearly increase on average over a period of time.... similar to the prior account I had where I averaged 7.5% yearly growth). 

&#x200B;

I guess I am here because I would love to know what to do. Should I go with his idea of investing it to where he expects I will make 9-10% a year average? He mentions to do his, it still would be in a roughly conservative account where huge dips either up or down don't really happen, which keeps my money safer and slowly growing. . . Or is there somewhere else I can invest this, relatively safely, where I will see greater growth, but my money won;t just disappear due to a bad few years?

# First stock is obseva ticker symbol obsv. This stock already jumped 130% this week, but as you can see the price target is 28 on high, 22.5 on average and 17 on low, so this stock has still an insane upside potential from 400 to 500%. They are a clinical stage biopharmaceuticals company that works to innovate reproductive therapeutics for women. As you can see the big institutionals are buying a ton of this stock, institutionals bought 4.7 million shares while they sold only 1.9, so they’re really loading up on this stock! Also institutionals increased positions by 5.4 million while decreased position only of 3.5. This is a clear sign that they either really belive in the company or, they know something that we don’t know, and they’re buying so much because they know the stock will skyrocket soon. 

# Is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 10. So if you bought with me you made a good 250% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more, in fact I haven’t sold any of my shares yet. The stock today jumped a ton, because the co founder was included in joe biden science team. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned.

Make no mistake, this will be a hassle over chemistry books and then when I find the right one I will have to delve over physiology, biology, dentistry and prosthetics books to make it useful.

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

[https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw](https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw)

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform. So in my opinion once they announce good news, the stock will probably go up a lot.",UPS

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero!

This would be the list of the stocks to avoid at the moment in my opinion, some of you might not agree with this and that's fine:

1. Intel: Major US company that had lots of potentials. Now run by a boomer, who has no idea what he's doing, only smile for the camera. The company loses 20% in less than a week. What did they do? Nothing.
2. SPAC stocks: Also known as blank check companies. They generate 0 earnings, except if they are able to sell some of their shares.
3. TSLA: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up.
4. PLTR: At the moment is a stock to completely avoid. The PE ratio and other fundamental ratios simply can't explain this company valuation. I am pretty much aware that the company has a lot to offer and this and that, but if you really look at the numbers this simply doesn't seem to add up. + Besides the same argument as the one I made for TSLA, the company is yet to make a profit.

Now I do some swing trading 2-30 days on momentum but largely I'm an investor, not a trader. I try to identify companies with a long term track record, good revenue, and especially those that have gotten beaten up by outside events, sector issues, or the economy in general and accumulate those. Companies that accumulate billions of dollars in cash and don't bother to pay a dividend don't get my interest (AAPL). Neither does the latest fad, or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, ppl have made money but more have lost everything. Hacking wallets is a daily job in countries like North Korea and Russia.

When I first started investing with $100 in college it was 1987, yup lost my ass in October but looking back it was one of the most valuable lessons I could have had. It helped prepare me for 2008 when I lost 0 and made 0. That break even was huge and set the stage for the next 12 years of my successful investing career. So yes, it's been successful but it's also been the ""slow and steady"" type of profit, only evident when you look back at where you were all those years ago.

So bionano genomics or bngo on nasdaq is a genome analysis company providing tools and service based on their saphyr system to scientists and clinicians conducting genetic research and patient testing. As they said in their annual report they developed the saphyr system, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detecetion, that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic target and to streamline the evaluation of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics. Seems cool right? And this techonology will be used by bionano customer that is praxis genomics 

Now, why is this company so innovational is because the current clinical diagnostic landscape is very labor and time intensive and so very costly. And this bring us to the point, that is genomic revolution. Kathy wood, the manager of ark funds, that were the best performing funds in 2020, talks a lot about this on ark invest website and her view on genomic revolution is very bullish. 

But before going into why is the saphyr technology is game changer, I just quicly wanted to thank you guys for all the support you’ve been giving me, and if you are watching this video and you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, it doesn’t cost anything to you but it does help me out so much. But now, back to the video! 

So, Genome analysis is the the process of extracting biological information from dna, but why is it so important? That’s because dna dictates the way our doby answer to certain drugs and in general how our body behaves. So for example in an hospital, a doctor may has to do some tryes before finding the drung that will solve our problem, instead if he already knows what is our dna is , so he knows how our body reacts to certain drugs, he will just give us the right one. And so knowing the dna of a patient can save the nurse and the doctor a lot of time, and as you may know time is money and so the hospital can save a lot of money also because they don’t have to waste any drugs, that generally are very costly to buy. We all know that healthcare is a business that is based on both the best outcome possible for the patient but also money is very important, so the less they spend the better it is. 

Now why is bionano genomics techonology so revolutionary? As you can see in this graph it used to cost 100m just to analyze one genome in 2001 , to this days even though the cost has been reduced by a lot, it does still costs a couple of hundred bucks just to analyze a genome, so for a patient could be spent up to 1 or 2 thousand of dollars. But the saphyr techonology can reduce this cost basically to zero, just the cost of the machine itself that is no basically nothing if we consider that it can be used an infinite ammount of time. 

So bionano genomics is a company that can help healthcare business save a lot of money, that is exactly what every company in the world wants, to save money. Also generally this techology can be used for advanced researches, for example has been shown to be more effective at finding structural variants than its competitors and It's also significantly more cost-effective. For these reasons, analysts expect Saphyr to gain broader adoption in genome sequencing and research applications. Generally the worldwide market for genomics product and services is expected to reach 24 billion by 2020, and considering that is was 14.7 billion in 2014, this makes is a compund 10% annual growth, that is an insane rate! This company operates in one of the fastest growing market in the world and has one of the most revolutionary techonology over last decade!",UPS
0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",UPS

I recently hit a milestone in my high-yield savings account ($75k) and now I am looking to set up bi-weekly investments into ETFs. I plan on using my capital to invest in residential multi-family real estate deals in the future so I’m just looking to make some extra earnings on my capital moving forward.

I’m looking at investing in SPY (50%), ICLN (20%), and VGT (30%) on a bi-weekly basis. Does anyone have other ETF suggestions? My plan is to make bi-weekly investments (~$2,500/month) and be able to cash out of these investments (if needed) in 1-5 years for real estate deals, wedding, etc.

0,1609276167.0,"There are a lot of news about Nio:  9 Jennuary is going to be a really important day, because it will be the annual Nio day event, that is usually used to launch new products, such as Nio new sedan! a Chip shortage Could actually decrease nio productivity capacity for December and Also nio teamed up with China’s State Grid to build battery charging. So I’m going to break down all this news and than give you my thought and the my  price prediction! If you want more information you can check the video! [https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA](https://youtu.be/MReyYsApNOA)

But to understand everything First we have to talk very very quickly about what is nio. It is the top  Ev maker in china, that is currently the biggest market in the world! Meaning that people buy more ev cars in china than everywhere else in the world! They’re currently making only Suv but on on 9th jenuary that is going to be nio day, they will announce a new sedan! It is also believed the company could start mass manufacturing the model by the fourth quarter of 2021. This event is the one that nio investor from all over the world are waiting for and in my opinion they will be announcing a lot of very good news, that will take nio to the next level! Also there is another thing that makes nio a different and way better company than it’s competirors, that is the ability to swap batteries, so this means they’re upgradable and more cost efficient! NIO teamed up with Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), China’s biggest maker of electric car battery packs, to work on battery-swapping technology. And why is it so important? Because Chinese government has dangled incentives to encourage such technologies. Electric cars that come with a battery-exchange plan are given a  very Generous incentives that have boosted a lot Nio sales car! Nio is expected to announce a 150 kilowatt-hour battery back that will likely increase the range of its EVs to over 900 kms.The new pack is expected to be compatible with all existing Nio models so this means that they’re upgradable, and that’s why nio up has established 143 battery-swapping stations across 64 cities in China.  Nio is also collaborates directly with the chines government in fact it has signed an agreement with State Grid EV Service, a unit of China’s state-owned electricity distributor, to build 100 stations across China by 2021. Durable, affordable and accessible batteries are necessary for realising the Chinese government’s ambition for one in five vehicles on the country’s roads to be driven by non-fossil fuels by 2025. 

&#x200B;

And this is one of the most important thing to understand, this is the thing that will make nio sale go up so much in the next months, because this  means that the government will do everything to boost ev cars sales, and nio is in a primary position to benefit from this, because it is currently the leader of the chines ev markers, and has already done a lot of collaboration with the Chinese government, so it will incourage people to buy nio’s car and give people even more incentives to buy them! Moving onto the next news, NIO has apparently been affected by chip shortage—their December production is approximately 5,000. This was mentioned by the president of NIO at the annual communications meeting last week. But he also mentioned that there will be no problem for Nio total deliverable to be over 6000. There are stock left in warehouse and 200+ stores. So this means that there will be no issue for nio to meet their Q4 target and production will ramp up to 7500 in January. And that’s why you should not believe to all rumors! Nio stock price went down also because of this, while it wasn’t even a true news! They also said that they want to start making their own chips, and this could be announced on Nio’s day! Nio stock after a lot of bad news, mostly not even true such as the possible delisting from Nasdaq has been pulling back a lot, from it’s peak that was around 55, to even 40-39 and now it’s back up at 44, but still down 20% from it’s peak. But once nio announces that it has met his Q4 production target the stock will go up again, and than on nio’s day the stock will literally skyrocket.",UPS

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",UPS

It should be an interesting ride. 

I've only had experience with one IPO before, LendingClub, and that seems like it was a good while back. I got in pre-IPO only because I was a lender on the platform. It was a hell of an experience, and I made it out ok, but aside from Alibaba, I've had zero interest in IPO's since then.

My idea doesn’t just consider only autistic children or adults; their families, people with anxiety disorders etc.

The lights. Sounds. Smells. Set up.

I would offer my services on a consulting basis. I would go into a store and point out easy, cost effective ways to implement more sensory friendly environments. I can handle being in Walmart maybe 15 minutes before I have a meltdown and have to leave.

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",UPS

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

I receive a small stipend from my university, about enough to live off, however from this I owe ~$700 in federal taxes for the 2014 year. My parents both work in finance and they were explaining to me that if I invest $1.1k in a traditional IRA then I won't end up owing any federal taxes. They figured it would be good for me to invest some money in retirement at a young age, and learn a bit about investments. I'm a financially frugal person, and have always wanted to own stocks, so this is really exciting for me in kind of a nerdy way.

My dad told me to open a traditional IRA through Vanguard (not a roth IRA). He said I can pick from any number of investments, and that I should do my research and find one I like.
 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
 
I have three questions:

&nbsp;

1) Can I open my IRA by investing in an ETF? Based on a little research i did, i like the Vanguard Health Care ETF as a high risk option, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF as a less risky option. 

2) What are my options for investing only 1.1k. I see a lot of vanguard options require a 3k minimum. 

3) Also, what kind of investments would you suggest? I am only investing a small amount, and i'm young, so would it be better to pick a high risk and highly volatile option? Or would a safer option, like the S&P 500 still give me and equally good return in the future?

Hi everyone, today I wanted to talk about 5 penny stocks that costs arround 2 or 3 dollars, one even 13 cents  and have very high potential to double or even triple they’re value. If you want more information watch the video! [https://youtu.be/V-YbpVzM0a8](https://youtu.be/V-YbpVzM0a8)

The first stock is colorstar technology or cscw on Nasdaq. through its subsidiaries, provides online and offline music education services in the United States throught CACM Group NY and China. It also offers Color World, an online cultural entertainment platform that provides celebrity lectures, celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, and artist interactive communication.. Color World App offers both a Chinese version, which launched on September 10, 2020 and an international version, to be launched by the end of 2020. Since its launch in less than three months ago, the Chinese version has already attracted over 600,000 registered users and over 50 celebrity coaches. The revenue is set to grow a lot in the next years, doubling from 2021 to 2022 and to grow even more in the following years. 

Next stock is gevo incorporation or gevo on Nasdaq. It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Shares climbed this week after the [alternative fuel](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/renewable-energy-stocks/) specialist announced that it had exercised an option to purchase 239 acres of land in South Dakota, capitalizing on an expansion opportunity. It also said it had met the first milestone in its $1.5 billion contract with Trafigura, a commodities trading company, to secure control of a site by the end of the year. In August, the company signed the deal -- the biggest contract in its history -- to provide Trafigura with 25 million gallons per year in fuel, most of which will be renewable gasoline. 

Than we have artificial intelligence or aitx on over the country markets. It is a holding company, and it’s subsidiaries are all companies in the robotic and Artificial intelligence sector. This week the holding announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) has received an order from a large construction company for what RAD expects as the first of many [ROSA](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Froboticassistancedevices.com%2Frosa%2F&esheet=52329709&newsitemid=20201117005699&lan=en-US&anchor=ROSA&index=1&md5=41d294732eff6f7048b61b36205eb744)unit , is a self-contained, artificial intelligence to be deployed at the client’s managed properties across the United States. And also a lot recently commented that their overall sales funnel continues to accelerate and it is foreseeable that the Q3 ending sales plus contracts number may exceed the 133% growth noted in a prior press release. And also the conversion of debts and many other very good news. The company said that “RAD’s growth over the past several months has been remarkable, and we believe that this is merely the beginning of a steep growth curve,” “We look forward to delivering years of consistently improving results.” AI and robotic sector is developing like crazy in this years, and it’s still at it’s early stages so in my opinion it will be very important in the next years

Next is Alpine 4 technologies or alpp on over the country market, is a publicly traded conglometare with business related endeavors in, Software, Automotive Technologies, Electronics Manufacturing, and Energy Services & Fabrication Technologies. The company two days ago announced that it it’s board of directors has voted up to list on the Nasdaq, and this is to attract even more investors to raise more money. The revenue of the company has grown a lot, going from 14 million in 2018, to 28 in 2019 and 24 in 2020, but without q4, so it is expected to be over 30 million. This growth rate is pretty good, considering that they’re also cutting a lot the cost of the revenue! 

**Last we have MIND Technology**, **Inc**. provides **technology** and solutions for exploration, survey, and defense applications in oceanographic, hydrographic, defense, seismic, and security industries. The **Company** designs, manufactures, and sells specialized, high performance sonar and seismic equipment. The balance shit for the company is improving year by year, as you can see from the graph the debt is going down and the cash flow it’s kinda improving in the long term, but of course it took a big hit in 2020. This company is a bit riskier than the other ones",VZ

Today I’m going to be talking about 3 penny stocks of which I’m holding about 300 shares each, they’re trading at about 2 dollars, and they have huge growth potential. These stocks have some very good catalyst and I can see them having a very good run this year. It would be really appreciated also if you would check my youtube video, where you can find some more information!it. But now, let’s get straight to the point.  [https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE](https://youtu.be/RUTha-pRuNE)

The first stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand, Atossa is ready to execute its plan. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

The second stock is Vyne Therapeutics or vyne on Nasdaq. VYNE Therapeutics’ mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Their proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology platform is the foundation that allows them to rethink and reengineer topical innovation.So basically they’re technology is used to boost the efficiency and make already existing therapies better, and for this they’re actually getting a lot of money from investors, and many contracts from companies. For example just 2 days ago the company  announced the execution of a contract with a major PBM for its novel AMZEEQ and ZILXI**®** , the first topical minocycline to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any condition, is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne. This is the first acne therapy approved by the FDA, this means that this is really a game changer considering that it effects 50 million people only in the US every year. This effects people of every age, especially young people, in fact Acne effects 85% of the people between the ages of 12 and 24, but on some individuals, particurarly women can experience acne much later in life and also some individuals, acne continues even after they’re youth and this is really annoying. This therapy has really the potential to be a game changer in the way acne is threated and that’s why a lot of big investors are buying this stock. They currently cover 63% of the market, and this year they should be pushing this to about 90%, while also trying to expand and make some other therapies for other skin related problems. Their consumer approach is also very intelligent, because of course this type of problem affect mostly young people and that’s why they’re trying to increase they’re presence in the web, by increasing the presence in top search engine, using social media account and paying influencers to sponsor their products. 

Last stock is  Ecor electroCore, Inc. is a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company. The stock right now is trading at 2.6, and it’s rated a strong buy. The price target are 5 oh high, 3.7 on medium and 3 on low, so about a 100% from now, even though in my opinion they’re very low, I think the stock can easily reach about 10 in fact the newest rating are way higher than 5. So this could actually be a 300-400% profit. But what does the company do? It is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through its platform non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation therapy initially focused on the treatment of multiple conditions in neurology. their main product is gammaCore™, that is the first non-invasive, hand-held medical therapy applied at the neck to treat migraine and cluster headache through the utilization of a mild electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve that passes through the skin. And it is approved by the FDA. This technology is very innovative and could find some very interesting use in the future. For example  today the company announced that Health Improvement Scotland has published a Scottish Health Technology Group adaptation for NHS Scotland on the use of gammaCore for cluster headache.",WELL

The first stock is sundial growers ticker symbol, sndl on Nasdaq.  It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. There are so many reasons for this company to go up this week. First of all past week they raised 100m thought selling more shares, but the stock didn’t go down, thing that usually happens, and that because everyone is refusing to sell their shares and the stock didn’t go up on Friday but just because Robinhood. limited the buy volume to 1 share. They Sought new revenue opportunities by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis but there are rumors that they will actually Acquire zenabis in a merger. Also there are rumors they can acquire Canopy in a merger. It is trending so much on both investing.com and stocktwits.com, as you can see beside the “short squeeze stock” it is the first one. Volume is up 149% compared to the avg, signaling lots of new interest and activity. The volume here is pretty unreal. It’s traded 1 BILLION + shares for 3 days in a row. Can’t say I’ve seen that too often. **Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:** 

· Eliminated slightly over C$220M debts from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December 2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.

· Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've announced the first product as a result of the concentrates partnership.

· Worked to expand their margins through an aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing at approximately $0.88 per gram.

And last a very long term thing could of course be the actual legalization of cannabis In the us, that right now with biden is more possible then ever.

The second stock is allied esports, ticker symbol ei-i-s-i on Nasdaq. is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. Its mission is to connect players, streamers and fans via integrated arenas and mobile esports trucks around the world that serve as both gaming battlegrounds and every day content generation hubs.   Video gaming-specific streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming give fans a direct connection to the players and teams and this company aims to enchance this exact thing not only giving players and streamers facilities to work into but also places where the streamers and the fans can actually meet in person. The esports industry is one of the fastest growing, with the Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Insider Intelligence estimates. That puts the esports audience on pace to nearly double over a six-year period, as the 2017 audience stood at 335 million. As a result, the industry has seen a huge uptick in investment from venture capitalists, and more recently from private equity firms. The number of investments in esports doubled in 2018, going from 34 in 2017 to 68 in 2018. And because all of this of course investments and revenue in the sector are growing at very high rates too, way more then expected. This graph is from 2017 and you can see that the revenue was 167 million in 2017 and was expected to be about 400 million in 2020, well it was 950 million, so way more then expected.

Next we have sellas life sciences ticker symbol sls on Nasdaq.

If you want for more details, such as price targets and when I’m buying the stock,  you can watch the youtube video, it would be really appreciated But now, let’s get straight to the video! [https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw](https://youtu.be/JVzN5wTbATw)

The first stock is BiolineRx, ticker symbol blrx on Nasdaq. It is a clinical stage biopharma company focused on developing new cancer treatments. The stock is currently trading at 2.79. Oncology is a major field for cutting edge biopharmas. Cancer is frequently deadly, and frequently resistant to current treatments – and those treatments themselves will frequently cause severe side effects in patients. BioLineRx has an active pipeline of drug candidates, but the most advanced is motixafortide, a synthetic peptide which has completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study on stem cell mobilization for autologous bone-marrow transplantation. Stem cell mobilization, using motixafortide, is seen as the company’s most efficient path to registering the new drug for regulatory approval. And many analyst think that this drug could actually make the company get a big chunk of the market. 

Next stock is kindred bioscience, ticker symbol kin on Nasdaq. is biopharmaceutical company in the veterinary market, developing biologic medications to improve the lives of our pets and working animals. The company describes its mission as ‘\[bringing\] to pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that human family members enjoy.’ Parvovirus (CPV) is a highly infectious, and highly lethal, viral disease affecting dogs. While vaccines are available, untreated cases can see upwards of 91% mortality. Kindred’s main pipeline drug, KIND-030 is under development as a treatment for this disease. The drug candidate is in the pivotal study stage of development, the last before potential approval.Last month, Kindred announced that it had entered an agreement with Elanco Animal Health – a major manufacturer of veterinary medicines – for production of KIND-030. 

The next stock is atossa therapeutics or atos on Nasdaq. I’m personally holding 300 shares of this company, and I plan on buying more in the future, because in my opinion it has a lot of potential. But before going into detailes, just a very quick reminder, if you’re watching this video but you aren’t subscribed, considering doing so, It doesn’t cost anything to you but it does really help me out so much. But now, back to the video.  Atossa Therapeutics develops and markets medical devices, laboratory tests, and therapeutics to address breast health conditions in the United States. The company’s lead program is the development of Endoxifen, which is in Phase II studies to treat and prevent breast cancer. The company in the past months has been selling a lot of shares and now with fresh capital in hand,and that’s one of the main reason I’m holding this company, because now they have a lot of money to execute their plans,. The company targets breast cancer, more recently, COVID-19. The company has a Phase I study to see the efficacy of its drug, AT-301. This is a nasal spray that can be taken at home by those suffering from the coronavirus. Dosing is complete, and data output is expected this month. And this is huge, one this spray comes out, I can really see it having a very big market. According to the company, its preliminary assessment is that AT-301 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated in this study Atossa has already filed provisional patent applications on AT-H201 to treat COVID-19 patients and AT-301 to treat patients diagnosed with, or to prevent, COVID-19 via nasal spray.

Last stock is a little bit of a bonus, considering it’s not a penny stock, but in my opinion it’s wort a mention, it is clover health ticker symbol clov on Nasdaq. It is a insuretech company. It’s software-based platform serves 57,000 seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. So at its core, it is basically a newer version of an old school health insurance provider with the potential to disrupt an industry in need of some refreshing. Clover gained $400 million public investment in private equity, or PIPE, and $828 million held in Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. III trust. That’s a nice amount of cash that can be used for future acquisitions or to bolster the company’s technology platform. So in my opinion once they announce good news, the stock will probably go up a lot.",WELL

Today we’re going to talk about 4 stocks that have a lot of potential. I’m holding about 200/300 shares in each company and I’m planning to buy more because in my opinion these have some very strong catalyst and plans for the future. If you want more information you can watch my youtube video![https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ](https://youtu.be/aDK4vjYaFlQ)

The first is a penny stock and it is Sundial Growers ticker symbol SNDL on Nasdaq. Before going into details, this is a long term investment, this stock will soar one good news about cannabis legalization come out. It is a Canadian cannabis retailer the company has devoted considerable focus over the past six months to transforming their business. I already own 300 shares of this company since it was at 0.55, I sold all of them when the stock spiked at 1 to make an easy 90% return, and now I’m buying them again. Before going into the actual strategies, this moves indicate us that they are trying very hard to actually get more space in the market and with the prospect of further addressable market expansion in Canada and potentially in the United States, this could actually work really well for them. Some highlights of their strategies are:

&#x200B;

* Eliminated slightly      over C$220M from their balance sheet in 2020, and as of late December      2020, are debt-free. This freed-up cash that previously went to interest      payments will be used to pursue strategic investments instead.
* Pursued strategic partnerships to expand into      the concentrates and edibles markets. Just in the past      week since I last discussed Sundial's strategic direction, they've      announced the first product as a result of the concentrates      partnership.
* Sought new revenue opportunities      by purchasing outstanding debt in a competitor, earning periodic      debt payments and sales-based royalties from Zenabis.
* Worked to expand their margins through an      aggressive approach to per-gram costs, eventually looking to reduce      per-gram costs to just C$0.68 (from C$1.18 currently). This cost-based      approach could allow Sundial to compete for market share with companies      like Aurora Cannabis, which are currently producing      at approximately $0.88 per gram.

In my opinion right now cannabis legalization in the us is more possible then ever with biden’s election, I think this company could actually go up a lot if that happens. But on the other hand it’s pretty risky, considering that it’s related only to one catalyst.

 Next stock is amc entertainemtn, ticker symbol amc. This is a only a speculative investment, no fundamentals or catalyst. The stock right now is going throught what it’s called a short squeeze, I’ve explained more in this video, but basically the company, that is a teather company has been hit a lot by the pandemic and so a lot of institutionals were shorting the stock. But Because when a stock that a lot of people are shorting starts to go up, the shorter get nervous and so they start buying to cover. And the higher it goes, the more they have to cover, the more they are obliged to buy and the more the stock goes up. And all of this drives the price up and compounding the problem and, if it’s a stock with a lot of visibility… well… buying gets buying. And this stock is literally one of the most trending stock on reddit, expecially on r/pennystocks and they’re actually trying to buy it in mass, so this stock could be going up a lot these days. This stock is completely related to gme, when gme goes up it goes up, and right now the r/wallstreet bet army is ready to let the stock blow up, so I’m expecting the same thing to happen with amc. 

Also the same thing might be happening with some other stocks, such as black berry ticker symbol bb, nokia, ticker symbol nok, bbby 

Last stock is gevo, that in reality is a long term holding, that is gevo ticker symbol gevo on Nasdaq. I already did a video, on this company while it was only at 3.7 and now it’s a 11. So if you bought with me you made a good 300% profit, but in my opinion the stock has a lot of potential go up a lot more. I  sold my shares when the stock spiked up at 13, to secure a 350% profit. But what is gevo?It  is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company that develops bio-based alternative to petroleum based products. Gevo announced t the first project in its new Net-Zero series, which is designed to create energy dense liquid hydrocarbons that deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when burned. Also they payed off 12.7 million in convertible notes, reducing their debt balance to zero! This company is literally the trend of the future and they have a very great management with very good plans.",WELL

0,1610211781.0,"Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",WELL

The first stock is Artelo Biosciences or ARTL on Nasdaq. It  is a biopharmaceutical company. The company focusses on development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of novel, endocannabinoid system modulating therapeutics. Currently the stock is going for 0.72 per share, but it has a lot of potential.The big catalyst right now is that ART27.13 Is a product that can increase appetite and food intake and so it could be used in treatment of cancer-related anorexia. The company plans to advance this art27.13 as a supportive care therapy for cancer patient suffering from weight loss and anorexia, where the current annual global market is estimated to be valued more than 2 billion! In my opinion it is a very good investment, this could really be a stock that could go up a lot considering that it is up only 17% this week so it hasn’t gone up that much yet ,it has lot of momentum, as generally are having biopharmaceutical companies right now.

&#x200B;

The second stock is Jaguar Health inc or jagx on Nasdaq is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, plant-based and sustainability derived prescription medicines for people and animals with debilitating diarrhea, I know it doesn’t sound that good but just wait. The stock right now is going for about 0.82 per share. But what’s the major catalyst? Well the company right now has two drugs, Mytesi that is already approved by the fda and canalevia that is still in clinical stages. Jaguar health has announced it has signed a royalty agreement for mytesi worth 6 million. As a result the company will be able to use the proceeds to pursue more regulatory activity, in fact it is hoping to receive further fda approval for more uses, such as a treatment for cancer therapy-induced diarrhea. Also they’re working to expand in Europe, in fact in reality their product are actually made by napo that is a wholly owned subsidiaries that also work in Europe. And they want to use it as a treatment for patients dealing with long-term covid19 recovery. This last thing is just plan of the company it hasn’t officialised it yet, but once they do I think the stock will blow up

It has really the potential to be a gamechanger, in fact it has a very high fungicidal efficacy and also it has a lower level of toxicity than it’s competitors, that don’t come even close to it . This could also benefit patients of shorter hospital stays, lower costs and easier access to amphotericin B.And If that wasn’t enough, the company has recently announced a collaboration with the NIAID to study a liposomal nanocrystal, for an oral formulation of the COVID-19 therapy. In my opinion Considering both the very important and gamechanging catalyst and that in general biopharmaceutical companies are seeing a very big increase in their stock values, this could be a very solid investment, in my opinion for real the

The third penny stock is Equilibrium or EQ on Nasdaq, Equilibrium is developing innovative therapies for severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, by Leveraging an in-depth understanding of immunology and its role in disease. Right now the stock is trading for $5.3 and in case it drops just a tiny bit, it could be a very solid opportunity to triple your investment! I know 5.3 is kind high and maybe can’t be considered penny stock, but it is still pretty low and has very good potential!During the company’s Analyst Day highlighting its clinical programs for anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody itolizumab, the CEO remained optimistic about its long-term growth  EQ released individual patient responses along with biomarker analyses, that were very positive. Going forward, the company wants to conduct a lot of other experiments, that could possible lead to very impressive results. As for the updated data, the 3 cohorts of the phase 1b, there was an 80% overall response rate (ORR) across all doses by day 57, with 8 out of 10 total patients achieving a complete response (CR). What’s more, the therapy was also tied to the ability to taper and dose reduce systemic steroid use in patients.If that wasn’t enough, EQ presented preclinical and translational research supporting the Phase 1b EQUALISE trial for itolizumab in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN), and Smith expects top line results in SLE to come in 1Q21 and interim results in LN in 2H21.In my opinion this stock has a lot of momentum, and could explode in 2021, expecially if they deliver for real the impressive results they’re aiming for right now",WELL

0,1603793924.0,"I am invested in a small, privately owned startup company with a group of friends. This was an opportunity that became available as a result of a connection I made, and only required a small investment ($10k) that could potentially result in a 5-10x return over the years. 

The investor group is making a visit to the company and will have an audience with the CEO and several other key members of the organization. 

I would like to put a list of questions together that might be relevant to me, the investor. 

This company is involved in rapidly charging battery technology. They have gone through their Series A and B rounds and have completed all their fundraising, and are working toward executing the purchase orders they’ve received, procuring grant monies, continuing to develop technology, marketing themselves to companies like Tesla and cell phone companies, and things of that nature. 

Our investment is in the form of a convertible loan. The company is current with all interest payments. Our main questions are obviously geared toward profitability as well as the timeline for when our interest in the firm will convert to ownership shares.

9/16/20 Closed a complete blowout debut at $253.93, up 112%. A stunning $70.4B valuation and most successful IPO of the year. 

So, rich and elite investors who had early access got very, very wealthy today. The retail schmucks gladly transferred their wealth to them. So basically, just another day on Wall Street.

9/17/20 The afterparty: Opened down about 9 percent at $230. (most tech stocks are down as well, just not this sharply)

9/18/20 Closed out the week at $240, exactly twice the IPO price, imagine that.",WELL

0,1595339524.0,"I am 25 with $110K. No debt. 

About me:


I own a small high end condiment company that I am slowly growing national. Currently in 20 states about $40K in sales very small but growing. Profit margin 43% per bottle. Product is all legal, federal, licensed, and insured and federally trademarked. 

I have a my crew I hire and pay per hour to make it at my commercial kitchen. 

We’re semi vertically integrated. We distribute ourselves. No, a distributor makes ZERO sense in the high end condiment field I am in. My uncle is a VO at US FOODS. He broke down the details to the grain of how much meat distributors take off the bone tand it was utterly stupid. 


I also own a small taxi company pre covid and now it’s out of commission until further notice. I was taking home a modest $24K per year from driving and doing that. I door knocked hotels and private jet companies in the area and earned their business and sat curb side. 

I live in an apartment full of old section 8 retires and disabled people by choice to save more money. 

I own a high end car that I paid cash. For the record, I pay “black book value” and I always sell my car before the car goes under “black book value” so I don’t lose money. I break even after 2 years of driving. 

Overall, I live below my means and penny pinch. I also have 2 children who I am saving for and have a trust fund established and I have a law firm on retainer for any issue or if anything happens to me. 

The Problem:

I need to find another model to earn money from. 

I have stocks, etfs, and I have some money at BlackRock in the technology opportunities fund. 

I have NO CREDIT CARDS. My credit is low as hell. 620 on all 3. 

I wanted to get into real estate, I have a mentor who is very well known and owns the majority of affordable housing in my county. I have another person who is a large developer. They’re offering 15% returns on $50K shares. There’s also another developer I know who offers 10% returns on $50K shares. 

However, I know the housing market is set to crash as the banks increased their minimum credit scores for FHA which means there is not less potential FHA candidates thus killing the demand for homes for the time being plus so many people not having jobs. 

I want to buy a 4 plex but I am trying to wait for the housing to fall a lot first. 

Any ideas, advice, or suggestion about where to potentially park my cash to keep it growing? 

Should I just sit this game out and watch everything unravel and then get in on the ground floor later on like warren buffet and BlackRock does during a recession?

So why stockval? There are hundreds of portfolio trackers out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a simple one that would be fast enough, have realtime prices and worked well on all devices. All I found seemed to be extremely bloated.

I've been tweaking stockval for over a year. Today, I finally decided to share this lightweight app with you, guys.

Please make sure you try all features, bookmark a customised URL (e.g. [https://stockval.co/10fb/usd](https://stockval.co/10fb/usd) or [https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd](https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd)), create a portfolio, save some alerts, and then share the app with your friends if you like it.

A friend used to work at Ford. Almost every day for 3 years he watched inventors walk by with some new contraption and come out later with a check, no contraption. 
When the MYT engine came to the L.A.Auto show everyone was real excited about it, as it had been tested well and proven a true gem. This was nothing like a rotary engine plagued with it's rotating seal problems. It was nothing like anything seen before in terms of pure power to weight ratio, enough to literally run off air and do this better than we've seen from modified flathead engines like on the 69 Toyota Corona. I'd drawn up plans for a very similar engine but noticed Raphial beat me to the patent and received a million dollar grant for development and testing which proved fantastic. 
Now I'm watching time go by and hear how Raphial has been promised funding at least twice with what would revolutionize the shipping industry for starters, potentially making billions in year one, but to date he's run out of money and lives in a hotel in Texas. 
He's been unwilling to sell stock for fear of losing it, and it's a smart move perhaps, perhaps not. 
In any case, others have been threatened by Ford to sell or shut up. Personally I think it would be wise to develop this with funding in another country. 
I barely know the inventor, but if you're looking for something great, I suggest you look at Angel Labs there or another option; I've since produced a somewhat similar design that avoids his patent since then. I can't afford the patenting yet but expect to later this year.
My intention is to buy out Vector Motors which has virtually little assets,  no patents, but Weigart still had molds for the legendary W8. To bring THAT car back into production with an engine that has a 4x power to weight ratio over anything by Ferrari etc... even with power to spare for cooling off the brakes, this is a winning formula. I've known Weigart a few years now. Some features of his designs are long overdue for real production. Darn those indonesians for destroying his company.",WELL

0,1545018245.0,"I'm a 58 year old high school teacher. I presently own two homes. One of my homes is a rental property in southern Arizona. I never actually thought to invest in rental property but when I lost my job due to state budget cutbacks and moved away, I found that since I had purchased the house relatively cheaply with 25% down, I was able to net $500/month in rental income. Since I live out of town and didn't want to have to deal with long distance repair and maintenance issues, this property has been supervised by a property management company and I've been pretty happy with the results.

The housing market for my current location is really tight so much so that there have been a lot of stories about it in the local news. It's so tight that people moving here to work have had to rent homes or apartments that are 30 minutes to an hour away. I just found a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a 2 car garage that's selling for $124,000. Similar properties in this area are renting for $950 and up.  Buying this rental property for 20% down and turning it into a rental property seems like a good idea to me.

I am NOT a handy person and as with the other property, I would engage the services of a property management company. I would of course have insurance on this property. I have insurance on my other property as well which was really good because when a torrential storm blew off the roof and a lot of the siding, the insurance company came through with reimbursement for the cost of repairs minus the deductible. Since I had the financial wherewithal to immediately engage contractors for repairs, I was able to get this rental unit fixed while other homeowners were waiting for their insurance payments to arrive. After getting their insurance payments, they found themselves at the end of a very long line of people waiting for contractors to repair their homes. The relatively quick repairs allowed me to keep my tenants.

What's making me a bit nervous is that I'm not a business person. I teach Culinary Arts. I've never owned multiple rental units before even though multiple in this case would just be two.  I therefore thought I'd ask the experts on this sub-reddit about your thoughts regarding this potential investment. I would appreciate any constructive feedback.

Thanks!

 I've had significant experience with buying then renting single family homes but my location (Silicon Valley) doesn't make cash flow sense and any buy then rent proposition is basically a form of land banking (buy, stay afloat, hope values go up, sell)... which I'm not comfortable with.

I was considering homes in the Lake Tahoe area but thought perhaps I should just put the money in private equity.  I'm already in Pretium's single family II and they're basically doing the buying/renting concept at it's core.  My question is.. how do the returns for personally buying and renting single family homes on a cash flow basis (of which I have very little fear) compare to RE focused private equities (of which i understand and thus have less then average fear)?  Pretium I did very well I think...

I'm not sure I can get more then 15% ROI by myself... and even if I did... the pain may not be worth it (I've had some seriously boneheaded renters before).  Anyone have examples.. specifically in the Tahoe area would be great?",WELL

In Costa Rica, is possible to get good interest rates in investments that are VERY low risk as well as make investments in real state deals and later sell it.

The general (non) consensus seems to be that oil prices will rise in the second half of 2017 before increasing further in 2018, or that they will remain low/static for that period.  

The arguments frequently used surround OPEC (2017 strategy, policy), UAE (strategy, policy), the kick in price of shale in North America and the global demand increases from China and India, as well as global peak demand not being achieved yet.
