Just stumbled on this via the chrome web app store and thought it was quite cool. It basically offers a system that takes the available financials on a publicly traded company and gives you a fundamental ananlysis. 

Pros:

* Clean and simple interface
* On-screen explanations of metrics
* A comprehensive FAQ
* Free

Cons:

* Only covers 4 exchanges (NASDAQ,NYSE, AMEX, TSX)
* Only provides information on companies with 5+ years of financial records
* Does not take into account possible gaps in records for valuations given to stocks
* Only uses a limited amount of metrics for its valuation

Has anybody had any experience with this?",ATVI

So what are some good, cheap stocks I should look at picking up during this exchange ""fire sale"" right now?",ATVI

0,1440693689.0,"So ever since I was a little kid I have wanted to be involved in Investment Management. My Mother used to be an overnight fed funds broker, and moved something in the neighborhood of 6 Billion a week to various banks. This lead to us taking multiple trips to NYC as a kid, and when I fell in love with NYC. I visit NYC about three to four times a year, and a few of my Fraternity brothers live there now, but are not in the industry.  

I am currently finishing up my joint MBA/MS(Finance - Asset Management) (3.25 GPA), from a well ranked program. I plan on pursuing a CFA thereafter.  I have 5 years of Direct and Wholesaling experience under my belt for 401k record-keeping. I love the deals side of our business, so front office is where I feel I would fit best in. I am open to pursuing opportunities outside of the 401k side, and would like to focus more on the investments portion. I am 26 years old, and I feel as though it would be an ideal time to try to make this transition. I have read plenty of journals as far as what work might look like on a day to day basis. So I am not afraid to sacrifice social time, or work long hours, late nights.

But I am still very hazy on just how to get up there, and get my foot in the door. I am also trying to get a better idea of what income may look like. I have checked Glassdoor, but I feel that is still not a very good representation of what the take home is. As the AE's I support take some in the range of 500k and on the website they list them to take home 125k. Are recruiters worth checking into? Should I still to the large companies? How would one get a job in a smaller shop? I am open to being PM'd for further detail and more in-depth conversation. 

Today I woke up and realized that the city I currently live in, I am not happy here at all. So I am looking to change that. As always feedback is much appreciated.

0,1530884749.0,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-06/oil-spike-above-150-feared-as-investors-demand-cash-over-growth](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-06/oil-spike-above-150-feared-as-investors-demand-cash-over-growth)

Oil investors may regret urging companies to cough up cash now instead of investing in growth for later as the dearth of exploration is setting the stage for an unprecedented crude price spike, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Companies have been compelled to focus on boosting returns and shareholder distributions at the expense of capital expenditures aimed at finding new supplies, analysts including Neil Beveridge wrote in a note Friday. That’s causing reserves at major producers to fall and the industry’s reinvestment ratio to plunge to the lowest in a generation, paving the way for oil prices to surpass records reached last decade, according to Bernstein.

“Investors who had egged on management teams to reign in capex and return cash will lament the underinvestment in the industry,” the analysts wrote. “Any shortfall in supply will result in a super-spike in prices, potentially much larger than the $150 a barrel spike witnessed in 2008.”

The world’s oil majors including [Royal Dutch Shell Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RDSA:NA) and [BP Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BP%2F:LN) navigated the price crash of 2014 by cutting costs, selling assets and taking on debt to help satisfy investors with hefty dividends. The biggest, [Exxon Mobil Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XOM:US), was [punished by shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P5A1YH6VDKHT) earlier this year after compounding disappointing results with a massive spending plan and a lack of buybacks.

The oversupply of crude globally in recent years has masked “chronic underinvestment,” Bernstein said in the report. Oil has rebounded to the highest in more than three years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies started curbing output at the beginning of last year to trim a global glut. The producers aim now to [pump more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-26/opec-supply-buffer-shrinks-as-it-answers-calls-to-pump-more-oil) to help cool the market, but disruptions from Libya to Venezuela are keeping prices elevated.

Proven reserves of the world’s top oil companies have fallen by more than 30 percent on average since 2000, with only Exxon and BP showing an improvement, helped by acquisitions, Bernstein said. Meanwhile, more than 1 billion people will urbanize in Asia over the next two decades and this will drive demand for cars, as well as air travel, road freight and plastics that also require oil, according to Bernstein.

“If oil demand continues to grow to 2030 and beyond, the strategy of returning cash to shareholders and underinvesting in reserves will only turn out to sow the seeds of the next super-cycle,” the analysts wrote. “Companies which have barrels in the ground to produce, or the services to extract them, will be the ones to own and those who do not will be left behind.”

Brent oil rallied to an all-time high above $147 a barrel in 2008 as booming demand growth and a lack of readily available resources fueled a synchronized surge across commodities that was dubbed the super-cycle. The global benchmark was at $76.78 a barrel as of 11:57 a.m. in London on Friday, up about 60 percent in the past year.",ARE

Happy Dow 21,000!

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 300 points to top 21,000 for the first time"" yesterday, and did you know that the Dow has closed at an all-time high 41 times in the last 12 months? That's about one out of every six trading days. And it's 15 times in 2017 so far, or almost twice a week. New Dow all-time highs are now less noteworthy than Tuesdays. Of course only five of the last year's closes crossed new 1,000-point thresholds (17,000 through 21,000), but still: five. Are you getting a little bored of celebrating new Dow milestones? Are you ... I am sorry ... tired of winning? Anyway here is a story about how 1,000 is 5 percent of 20,000 but 10 percent of 10,000, which is another reason to be bored I guess. We should pick an arbitrary starting point and then celebrate each subsequent 10 percent increase, or just start reporting the log of the Dow rather than the level.",ALLE

0,1566048606.0,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",ALLE

**Video Link:** [https://youtu.be/-7I7OAC6ih8](https://youtu.be/-7I7OAC6ih8)

The Securities & Exchange Commission has a treasure trove of financial data that is free for download. Since we want to do some machine learning models that require financial data let's take a look at how to web scrape this public data for our use. In this video, we will explore how to scrape all the filings for a single company.

**Video Title:** How to Web Scrape the SEC | Part 2

**Video Link:** [https://youtu.be/eut8-iOiJ\_Q](https://youtu.be/eut8-iOiJ_Q)

This is part two of our series on web scraping the SEC website. In this video, we will see how to scrape the daily index archives to find all the fillings for any given day of the year. With these files, we can easily access the individual documents and filing landing pages that contain XML maps.

**Video Title:** How to Web Scrape the SEC | Part 3

**Video Link:** [https://youtu.be/eut8-iOiJ\_Q](https://youtu.be/eut8-iOiJ_Q)

In this video, we explore how to parse the financial documents inside a 10K filing. We focus mainly on the financial statements and how to extract data from them and discuss how they fall into the bigger scheme of the archive. This video will also cover how to parse the Filing Summary XML file which provides a detailed structure of the archive folder.

0,1378322918.0,"I was offered a job at a Broker firm which sponsored me for my series 7 (passed) and 63 (supposed to take this Sunday).  I began working yesterday and found out it was a 100% cold calling job.  I originally thought it was 70% this plus some other tasks.  The job was 13 hour workdays (7:30 AM - 8 PM) and the first 3 months were training, in which I would be paid $300/week.  

Yesterday, on my first day, I was given a script to memorize about a stock to sell which included me lying to the customer (saying I had spoken to them before earlier in the year about a stock that had jumped in price 40% and that they missed out on the investment).  I spent about 5 hours yesterday and another 7 hours today cold calling people with about 6 total pitches (reading the script all the way through) and 0 clients.  I felt very guilty about this whole ordeal and very dirty because I felt like I was lying to people and then even if they say they are not invested (politely) I am supposed to ignore them and continue with the script until they hang up.

I quit on my 2nd day, because this is not what I thought I had signed up for.  I feel like it isn't a waste of time because I did get my series 7 out of this, so only the past 2 days were a waste, I feel like...although did learn what I don't want to do.

My question is are all broker firms similar to this type of job?  Of course there need to be some amount of cold calling, but are there people who work at these firms that devote 100%of their time to this task?

Sorry for the big rant, just wanted to provide the specifics of what went down the past few days.  There are more things, but I think I covered most of what was bothering me.

EDIT:  A lot of people keep commenting on how there were criminal activities done at this firm.  While I did dislike my time here, I am failing to see specifically what crimes were committed.  Can people please explain what I am missing?",ALLE

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

""The ordinary way that an initial public offering works is that the company’s executives fly around the world meeting with investors and trying to convince them to invest. This tends to be stressful and exhausting for the executives, and there is no guarantee that it will work; the investors might be skeptical and refuse to invest, or invest at a lower valuation than the executives want. If you gave the executives the option of, instead, kidnapping all of the potential investors, bringing them to a central location, and torturing them until they agreed to buy shares at a generous valuation, some executives might choose the kidnap-and-torture option.

Happy Dow 21,000!

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 300 points to top 21,000 for the first time"" yesterday, and did you know that the Dow has closed at an all-time high 41 times in the last 12 months? That's about one out of every six trading days. And it's 15 times in 2017 so far, or almost twice a week. New Dow all-time highs are now less noteworthy than Tuesdays. Of course only five of the last year's closes crossed new 1,000-point thresholds (17,000 through 21,000), but still: five. Are you getting a little bored of celebrating new Dow milestones? Are you ... I am sorry ... tired of winning? Anyway here is a story about how 1,000 is 5 percent of 20,000 but 10 percent of 10,000, which is another reason to be bored I guess. We should pick an arbitrary starting point and then celebrate each subsequent 10 percent increase, or just start reporting the log of the Dow rather than the level.",ALL

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",ALL

0,1378322918.0,"I was offered a job at a Broker firm which sponsored me for my series 7 (passed) and 63 (supposed to take this Sunday).  I began working yesterday and found out it was a 100% cold calling job.  I originally thought it was 70% this plus some other tasks.  The job was 13 hour workdays (7:30 AM - 8 PM) and the first 3 months were training, in which I would be paid $300/week.  

Yesterday, on my first day, I was given a script to memorize about a stock to sell which included me lying to the customer (saying I had spoken to them before earlier in the year about a stock that had jumped in price 40% and that they missed out on the investment).  I spent about 5 hours yesterday and another 7 hours today cold calling people with about 6 total pitches (reading the script all the way through) and 0 clients.  I felt very guilty about this whole ordeal and very dirty because I felt like I was lying to people and then even if they say they are not invested (politely) I am supposed to ignore them and continue with the script until they hang up.

I quit on my 2nd day, because this is not what I thought I had signed up for.  I feel like it isn't a waste of time because I did get my series 7 out of this, so only the past 2 days were a waste, I feel like...although did learn what I don't want to do.

My question is are all broker firms similar to this type of job?  Of course there need to be some amount of cold calling, but are there people who work at these firms that devote 100%of their time to this task?

Sorry for the big rant, just wanted to provide the specifics of what went down the past few days.  There are more things, but I think I covered most of what was bothering me.

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

I’d like to come away with a better understanding of the whole ordeal as well as the current banking system so any and all recommendations are appreciated. Thanks a bunch. 

Edit; really thanks a lot to everyone for all the great recommendations, I probably won’t be able to read them all but this has definitely been a great help and hopefully people than me have or will get something out of this thread!",ALL
0,1533484268.0,"I'm about to go to college to study finance and I'm unsure about my direction in life. In this book the author seems to basically mock technical analysis which is contrary to what I thought investing was all about, and I'm wondering how much stock I should put in his words. Seems like a smart guy, certainly has a decent pedigree, but a lot of what he says seems like it is contrary to what investment professionals would say.

Generally, I have a cautious and conservative way of navigating new information and this book seems to trample on a lot of professionals and professions I had some amount of respect and deference to.

Should I be wary of this book or is it popularly accepted as correct? What should I do to make up my own mind?",ALL

I understand that volatility is held constant because we already have all the other inputs we need to calculate the BSM option price and, this (implied or historical) volatility can be matched the that of the market since we can just look up the actual price of an option at any time. Additionally, I know that holding volatility constant facilitates trade because buyers and sellers can agree on every input and the resultant BSM option price while holding different views of the future expected return and current value (over or undervalued) of the underlying asset. While the BSM really does provide us a good basis for valuing options contracts, I feel Black, Scholes and Merton all ""got off the hook"" by just setting volatility constant across all periods because this variable, in reality, does change.",ALL

If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

Here are my questions.

1. Does my major matter at all so long as it includes math and programming?

2. For anyone working in this field, how is it?

3. What are some books I can read besides popular books on banking and economics to learn more? 

4. If I wanted to transition from engineering to this field, what would be the best graduate degree?

0,1409268295.0,"FULL DISCLOSURE:  I own stock in both GOOG and AMZN


I didn't see a post in /r/finance about Amazon and Twitch striking a deal.  At first we heard Google was looking, so I suppose Twitch went out and found other possible buyers.

Anyhow, at first the deal struck me as odd.  Google would be a very good match for twitch.  Amazon, however, isn't a gaming/search/social site.  Quite honestly, any time I go to Amazon, I spend money.  Only once in a while does Google get a buck directly from my pocket (Chromecast, maybe a song or two.  Rarely an App).  Another full disclosure:  When I visited Google physically in Mt. View, CA, I bought a hat, a mug, and some stickers from their gift store.

Now, after searching reddit for Amazon/Twitch deal, and slightly breezing through the other /r/ sites, I can see that Amazon made a wise choice.

Twitch gets a gamer / video-er / sharer market that is unlike any other social network I know of.  The fan base is fierce and loyal.  Some like this deal, some do not.

From an investment standpoint, I can see Amazon making their money back from this deal within 5 years.  Maybe sooner.  As long as management at Amazon is diligent to assure the twitch community that nothing is changing, doesn't change twitch, and listens to the twitch community, they will have a loyal customer base; because that is what they bought.

Handling this type of acquisition inside Amazon may strain management in the beginning, and new talent will surely need to be brought in.  Finding synergies is fine, as long as the goal is to grow the customer base instead of the bottom line.  If Amazon starts making major changes to twitch, this will fail.

All in all, though, I think it can be a good match.  The technology is there.  The customer base is there.  The twitch brand is there (thank you twitchplayspokemon).  The logistics are there (does twitch need logistics?).

Did Google lose out?  Does it even matter asking that question?  In the old world of sneaky business, accountants, finance guys, boats, hos, and lawyers, one could argue that Google did due diligence and deemed twitch an egg; but made an offer to sucker a competitor in to the buy.  I highly doubt that since the twitch fan base is really appealing.  Besides, Google's mission statement is ""Do no evil"" (or something like that)

0,1398016461.0,"Is there a formula or metrics I can look at that tests put call parity in an environment with transaction costs?  I know in practice, PCP usually does not hold when we consider transaction costs but is there a test for it?  

Context:  My school is doing a trading competition, they take a random 3 mo of stock prices and use black scholes to generate option prices.  They then +/- a random variable with mean 0 to stock & option prices to add noise and add/subtract another well behaved random variable to determine the bid-ask spread.  Transaction costs are fixed and are 0.015 or 0.025 of total transaction value depending on what it is (stock vs option, long vs short).  

My idea is that since there is a lot of random noise thrown into prices, if the random variables shift prices favorably enough, there could be an arbitrage opportunity but I haven't been able to figure out the best way to test this.  

What I've been doing so far with a set of test data my professor generated, is testing PCP with mid prices for two dates ie: 4/7/2014 and 4/11/2014.  If there is a spread in PCP and it converges within this range, I then run the trades  and unwind them factoring in transaction costs (bid/ask spread & transaction coefficients) to see if it is profitable overall.  Unfortunately, this doing/unwinding the trades is very time consuming and I have yet to automate it with vba code.  I was wondering if there is a metric I can look that can help me make this decision faster?  I was thinking maybe doing something that looks at the PCP spread without transaction costs and comparing it to the transaction costs as a % of the spread but I have not been able to figure out the math & logic behind this.  

Any ideas on what people do in practice?",MO

Hey everyone!

I am dipping out of Med School and going to field finance. Why? For several reasons. My family has always been in business, it's in my blood, the way I think and appraise property when I'm walking down a street in Manhattan. I have been always working on the side with them, so I highlighted that in my resume and back the science stuff in the back. But I feel, this has given me an opportunity to read complex scientific articles and extract only useful information, think critically, and solve unique problems. I feel my negotiating skills, charisma, among others will definitely be an asset to any firm I join but there a huge roadblock...

How do I get my foot in the door? 

**PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I'M THE WRONG TRACK, THANKS :)**

I am open and all entry-level positions and found out some pros and cons working with a big or small firm. Big firms have money for training program so I will have a strong foundation enforced by people who push me harder. Smaller firms will offer quicker upper mobility, more hands-on training and much more exposure in comparison to a bigger firm. 

But if I really want to work with a larger firm, but it's really hard to get in, by my understanding. I guess I'm asking how do I become an analyst? Do I need to work at a small firm first for 8-9 mo. then transfer to a larger firm? How do you know there is an opening in a other firm? 

**It's late and I'm going to pass out, super tired. I know there's ton of sp. mistakes and grammatical errors. I want to add more information and clean this up. But I hope someone can give me a push in the right direction! Thanks for listening**

**EDIT 1: Thank you everyone for getting back to me. Ok some obvious stuff, I forgot to mention. I majored in Biology and minored in Economics. Also, yes finance is an extremely broad topic. I would love to do a summer internship anywhere, somewhere I can get my feet wet and acquire a taste of varying topics. What I am specifically interested is in something along S&T (Sales and Trading). I am about a year deep in my education, but I do not foresee a future in this at least for me.** I hope this helps driving a stronger decision. I have read over and most of the consensus is suggesting just get into a good b-school and that should jumpstart my career, right? ",MO

0,1409268295.0,"FULL DISCLOSURE:  I own stock in both GOOG and AMZN


I didn't see a post in /r/finance about Amazon and Twitch striking a deal.  At first we heard Google was looking, so I suppose Twitch went out and found other possible buyers.

Anyhow, at first the deal struck me as odd.  Google would be a very good match for twitch.  Amazon, however, isn't a gaming/search/social site.  Quite honestly, any time I go to Amazon, I spend money.  Only once in a while does Google get a buck directly from my pocket (Chromecast, maybe a song or two.  Rarely an App).  Another full disclosure:  When I visited Google physically in Mt. View, CA, I bought a hat, a mug, and some stickers from their gift store.

Now, after searching reddit for Amazon/Twitch deal, and slightly breezing through the other /r/ sites, I can see that Amazon made a wise choice.

Twitch gets a gamer / video-er / sharer market that is unlike any other social network I know of.  The fan base is fierce and loyal.  Some like this deal, some do not.

From an investment standpoint, I can see Amazon making their money back from this deal within 5 years.  Maybe sooner.  As long as management at Amazon is diligent to assure the twitch community that nothing is changing, doesn't change twitch, and listens to the twitch community, they will have a loyal customer base; because that is what they bought.

Handling this type of acquisition inside Amazon may strain management in the beginning, and new talent will surely need to be brought in.  Finding synergies is fine, as long as the goal is to grow the customer base instead of the bottom line.  If Amazon starts making major changes to twitch, this will fail.

All in all, though, I think it can be a good match.  The technology is there.  The customer base is there.  The twitch brand is there (thank you twitchplayspokemon).  The logistics are there (does twitch need logistics?).

Did Google lose out?  Does it even matter asking that question?  In the old world of sneaky business, accountants, finance guys, boats, hos, and lawyers, one could argue that Google did due diligence and deemed twitch an egg; but made an offer to sucker a competitor in to the buy.  I highly doubt that since the twitch fan base is really appealing.  Besides, Google's mission statement is ""Do no evil"" (or something like that)

They state ""AIG expected housing price to go up, but they went down instead"".

What is confusing me, is when they talk about the teaser rate running out, they have to pay at a ""normal"" rate, but it is an adjustable rate.

So it means that at on point, consumers payments will depend on the market well-being. I can understand that if it is enough regulated and controlled, it can be acceptable, but one can easily predict it's a step forward more predatory lending, so it's not a big issue (yet).

My question is, how can you explain all consumers payments went up and defaulted at the same time ? Does it mean most consumers who were lent money defaulted, or did most defaults happened in a narrow time period ? If this market was not regulated enough, then why are there people pushing for criminal charges ? Isn't the government part responsible in this ?

> You decide to buy 1,400 shares of stock at a price of $88 and an initial margin of 70 percent. What is the maximum percentage decline in the stock before you will receive a margin call if the maintenance margin is 35 percent?

My approach has been basically find the critical price and divide it by the original price. 

So, 1400 * 88 = 123200
123200 * .7 = 86240 (Equity)
Margin Loan is $36,960

Critical Price = (amt borrowed/#shares) / (1- Main. Margin)

So, 36,960/1400 = 26.4 
1-.35 = .65
26.4/.65 = $40.62

If $40.62 is the critical price and I divide that by the original purchase price of $88 wouldn't that give me the stock price decline? Which would be 46.15%.

What am I missing here? Also, Sorry if this shouldn't be here.

**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 9.05am  
Announcement – New strategic focus for All Options**
  
  
Dear Colleagues,
  
We are in the midst of a market that has changed significantly. As many of you know, market making, our core business model, is dependent upon volume, and volume has died out in many of our markets. Today we see an environment where technology is critical, where the volumes in the underlying stock markets are declining, where investors seek safe and secure investments, where trading is being centralized into larger blocks of trade and dark pools, or going off-exchange completely. In addition, no one can predict when the markets will recover, if at all. This is not the market conditions the company was designed for in its current form. We as a company must change, we need to have a strong focus on what we are good at. Market making as we experienced it is dying out and we need to evolve. We are a trading company – and we need to focus on how we can get that profitable trading business back. 
  
What we intend to do is move away from primary market making obligations that lose us money, to focusing on sophisticated proprietary trading strategies in markets where we can gain real value, stopping loss making markets, reducing our traded-products portfolio, simplifying our infrastructure, and investing in dedicated technology.
  
With deep sadness I need to tell you that one of the unfortunate ramifications for this new strategy is that today we have to tell you that we will be closing our office in Hong Kong. The target date for closure of the HK office will be 1st January, 2011. I thank the team there for all of their efforts and hard work. We will however remain present in one of the Asian markets with our development of technology for Korea.
  
We also preparing to implement the new strategy in our Willemstad and Zug offices, with the international Managing Directors being informed this morning. In addition, I will personally be informing all of the Amsterdam employees more about the changes in a town-hall meeting at 13:00 today, in the Mercury Hall / Mercurius zaal at BP5. Please can everyone attend.
   
We need to embrace change and truly make the very best of it, we cannot dwell in the past and need to create a new winning team spirit and focus. Only then we can survive in today’s environment.
   
With best regards,  
Allard W. Jakobs  
On behalf of the Board of Directors  
     
**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 15.07pm   
Announcement – Further update on new strategic focus**
  
  
Dear Colleagues
   
I would like to outline more details to the intended new strategic focus for the company, which I also announced earlier today in person to the Amsterdam staff.
 
As a company that relied primarily on market making we were operating in market conditions unlike anything encountered in the last ten years. In many of our derivatives markets volume has dropped significantly, volatilities are flat, margins thin and investors are seeking other routes for their investments. What this means is that we were losing money in positions that we were obliged to take as a primary market maker.
 
In these new times, we need to change, to evolve our trading approach to take advantage of our position in markets where we can build stable revenues. What I intend to do, and which is now being reviewed by the Amsterdam Works Council, is a new focus for our company.
 
The aim of this strategy is to increase revenues by putting more focus on profitable markets, to align current cost levels with our lower revenues, and to re-establish the balance between our IT and business support group size in line with Trading.
 
To implement this strategy there will be three functional areas in the company: Trading, IT and Business Support.

The key developments in Trading will be:

* Simplify our trading infrastructure – have one office in Amsterdam, one clearing house, and one trading platform

* We intend to stop trading on loss making markets and focus only on those markets where Trading believe profitable trades are possible and are supported by ScreenTrader

* Closure of the Hong Kong office

* Simplify our product portfolio – reduce it from the 350 traded products we have now

* We intend to stop bidding for PMM memberships in unprofitable markets

* To reduce loss making broker flow by focusing on trades that generate value for the company

* We intend to stop all other loss making or marginal trading activities including ceasing with algo trading and 
energy trading

* Maintaining a small trading strategy group to do fundamental trading research: instrumental in developing new proprietary trading strategies

* Maintain our dedication on continual professional development for all traders
   
For IT the key developments are:
   
* Make IT Services one integrated team

* Continue to invest in the V2 trading platform with renewed focus on the markets we believe we can gain value from

* Relaunch AtomPro for all of our IT activities with a strong focus on the development of new technology


For business support, the proposed changes are intended to better realign the various support functions to more adequately match the size and scope of our intended new trading operations. Several departments will see staff reductions and we will integrate all of the Amsterdam staff into one building.
   
I do understand that this proposed new structure is a big change and you will all no doubt have many questions and concerns.
 
As I stated in my live presentation, I am ready and willing to take any questions you have, but recommend that you first talk to your department manager.
 
These changes are necessary for the company to continue to be a challenger in the markets. Only then can we survive in today’s environment.

0,1422847406.0,"I am trying to figure out a way to identify the leading contributors to the performance of multiple securities. For example, one idea I had was to run a multivariate regression using the securities returns as dependent variables and include things like oil, the dollar, the euro, treasury yields, etc.

E.g.,

SBUX + AAPL + MCD + BAC + TWTR = intercept + oil + dollar + euro + steel + gold + e

Would that be a correct way of seeing which variables are significant contributors to each of the stocks' performance?

Would Principal Component Analysis be a way of achieving the same end? A better way than multivariate regression? Is there another method suited to find these common contributors?

0,1382373399.0,"So I had a long position in AAPL that I wanted to exit today, and I sent in a market on open sell order. Right at the open, trading at ISLAND was suspended due to some technical issue and the order does not execute.

The opening price is somewhere in the area of 511.80.

I wait a bit to see if my order is gonna get filled, but I really want to get out ASAP, so I exit with a market order about a minute after the open (filled at 513.78). Before that I have sent a cancellation request for the first order.

Obviously when one thing goes wrong, everything else goes wrong as well, so at this point my computer crashes.

When I get my system back up at 4:45, I see that my market on open order was not canceled, and has now been filled and I've got a short position on.

The issue is this: the first order was filled at 4:38:05, when the best bid was ~515.56. However the price I was given was the one I would've gotten at the open, 511.52.

By the time I could exit the price had moved even further up and I got a fill at 517.60, for a loss of 6.08 per share.

The way I see it I should never have gotten filled outside the NBBO, if at all. Am I fucked or do I have a case to ask for the orders to be canceled? I'm in Europe and the amount isn't THAT large, so legal action would be infeasible and pointless.

0,1421521575.0,"Hi,

I am using excel to compile a data set in which I have variables indicating the ticker of companies I am looking at (e.g. AAPL, IBM, etc.) and the year.

I am trying to create a new variable for stock price beginning of that year for that ticker, and for the stock price at the end of that year.  I want to tell excel to gather it from a source and to automatically input it.

Format: http://imgur.com/kKFCkRK

For example, if I am looking at AAPL for 2014, I want to tell excel to input beginning and end of 2014 stock price in its respectful column.

Hopefully this comes off as very amateur-ish (apologies if it does), because I want to find a way to do this !  I will be gathering a rather large data set so I want to simply tell excel to look up the ticker and year and to input the info for stock prices.",AAPL

Where can I find this data?",AAPL
0,1408030914.0,"American-style options, obv.

For instance, [AAPL right now](http://imgur.com/NczBoEj) has 

    [1.08-1.13] spread for 96.43 strike = [97.51-97.56] at-the-money,
    [0.55-0.77] spread for 97.00 strike = [97.55-97.77] at-the-money,
    [0.57-0.58] spread for 97.14 strike = [97.71-97.72] at-the-money,
and then (I don't even know what this duplicate line means)

    [0.30-0.63] spread for 97.14 strike = [97.44-97.77] at-the-money.


AAPL is currently 97.41, making all of these nearly in-the-money right now, which makes sense since tomorrow they expire.

My question is: is there ANY reason to buy 1 contract at 97.14 strike, since AFAICT you'll make more money on the 96.43 strike? And... I guess I'm discovering the answer to my own question, as the higher strike will allow me to buy more contracts (0.58 vs 1.13 Ask; $1000 buys 17 of the first vs 8 of the latter).

     For anyone getting confused:
     96.43 strike has 1.13 Ask price and $1k would buy 8 contracts = 800 shares. 
     97.14 strike has 0.58 Ask price and $1k would buy 17 contracts = 1700 shares.

OK, writing that out made it all make sense. The difference in price reflects the increased leverage when they are in-the-money.

So, if all of that is correct... Is there anything else I'm not seeing that affects price? Speaking only of contracts that vary *only* in strike price.

EDIT: When I wrote ""large"", I was actually looking at next month's expiration contracts, but I accidentally grabbed this month's - which is why the variances are small (expire in 28.3 hours). ",AAPL
0,1384915605.0,"Hi Redditors! 

I'm a graduate student in a finance class, and have been basically stymied by an efficient portfolio question that I feel like should be easier than I'm making it. 

Here's what's given:

* I am currently invested in AAPL and treasury bills (I assume the t-bills are ""risk-free"")
* I have $1,000,000. $700,000 is invested in AAPL, $300,000 is in the t-bills
* AAPL has a Beta of 1.2 and an R-squared of 0.30, and assume that CAPM holds. 
* Risk Free Rate is 7%
* Market Rate is 15%

From all of this, I gathered that the expected return on the portfolio is 13.72%, because:

    (.7 x [.07+ 1.2 x (.15-.07)]) + (.3 x .07) = 13.72%

I am unsure how to calculate the portfolio's current variance or standard deviation (volatility)

**But** the problem is that this portfolio isn't efficient. How do I make it efficient? I think I want to find a portfolio that returns 13.72% with a smaller variance. 

Any help would be really appreciated, or feel free to PM me. I'm very confused, and just want to figure out how to do these types of problems because I'm sure I'll be tested on it. I've spent hours trying to figure out which formulas might apply, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere, and the professor has not been responsive. 

Thanks so much!

0,1389631052.0,"* In '97, Bill Gates helped his old frenemy, Steve Jobs, by purchasing 
$150M of AAPL stocks. Here are my questions about this transactions. 

* Why couldn't AAPL allow the general public to buy $150M worth of 
non-voting shares, but instead he went to only one entity - MSFT - for 
this financial lifeline? This is pricing discrimination, because our 
price is $INFINITY and MSFT's price was $150M. 

* When MSFT bought $150M worth of AAPL shares in '97, did they buy 
from the secondary market or did they buy from a new offering? These 
shares were non-voting anyways. 

* Why didn't AAPL issue$150M worth of high-yielding bonds to MSFT? 
This would have had more stability, paid a higher-than-normal yield, 
would have been tax favorable to AAPL, and they are also a non-voting 
investment in MSFT. 

* How does a company ""issue shares towards prosperity""? This 
dilutes EPS and just doesn't make sense to me. This is what doesn't 
make sense specifically: If a distressed company issues $100M of 
shares, then that distressed company's new business model is to simply 
issue shares and some C-level executives (i.e. CEO, COO, etc.) and i- 
Bankers get rich. But the new shareholders lose value over time. Their 
investment in a distressed company is bad. How do you issue your way 
to prosperity? 

* What effect would it have had if MSFT bought $150M worth of stocks 
in the secondary market (from the NYSE or NASDAQ exchange)? . ",AAPL

0,1429175626.0,"We need to revaluate stock prices of ADM (Archer-Daniels Midland-Company) at the 31st of december 2014 for a finance project. To do so we have been handed an excel valuation sheet. However we keep running into the same problem. ADM changed their fiscal year mid 2012 from running from the 1st of July to the 30th of june, to January 1st to December 31st. How do we account for this half year? 

we can't just make it disappear on the financial statements right? other students have just omitted the second half of 2012 from their financial statements, and they do get fair valuations for the stock prices, but I doubt this is correct.

0,1319308118.0,"I responded to an add online a while ago and a few days ago I got a call back.  I went in for an interview and they offered me a part time position while I'm still in school.

The company is a small brokerage (maybe 10-15 brokers) in my city.  The position they offered is entry level assistant to a full time broker.  If all goes well they offer Series 7 sponsorship in a few months. 

Problems:

* The job will include a LOT of cold calling which I'm not very comfortable with.

* I need to brush up on excel really badly.

* I don't especially want to BE a stock broker, nor do I have the ""personality type"" for it.  

I'm leaning towards taking the job for resume building reasons, but this isn't exactly the direction I want to take in my career.  Ultimately  would love to be a CFA but I know that's a long shot and I'll have to pay my dues beforehand.  Also, I fundamentally think that most individuals have no business actively and frequently trading hot stocks hoping to make a few bucks.  It goes completely against everything I've learned about responsible saving and investing techniques (saving, investing regularly in cheap index funds, keep costs and taxes low, rebalance as necessary, long term etc).  I don't feel comfortable selling BAC to old ladies as I would be expected to at a brokerage - SELL SELL SELL.

Just the thought of saying ""I'm a stock broker"" when someone asks me what I do for a living makes me laugh out loud!

Am I overthinking this?  Should I ""just do it"" and see what happens?  

Or should I go take this to r/firstworldproblems  ",BAC
0,1422847406.0,"I am trying to figure out a way to identify the leading contributors to the performance of multiple securities. For example, one idea I had was to run a multivariate regression using the securities returns as dependent variables and include things like oil, the dollar, the euro, treasury yields, etc.

E.g.,

SBUX + AAPL + MCD + BAC + TWTR = intercept + oil + dollar + euro + steel + gold + e

Would that be a correct way of seeing which variables are significant contributors to each of the stocks' performance?

Would Principal Component Analysis be a way of achieving the same end? A better way than multivariate regression? Is there another method suited to find these common contributors?

**Why Pivot Tables?**

Excel pivot tables are one of the most powerful tools in the Excel toolbox. They enable you to turn large amounts of data into concise, interactive summary reports in minutes. Despite their power, pivot tables remain a mystery to most Excel users – even to those with years of experience.  

In this course, we will demystify the pivot table, and make it accessible to the average Excel user.  

No more tedious manual sorting, subtotaling, filtering and complex formulas needed to summarize your data like a pro. With pivot tables it’s a point and click, drag and drop experience.

I also have a background in finance - corporate finance and investment banking. You can check out my bio at the above link.

I hope you like the course!

I am considering pursuing a masters of finance, and I am hoping for some advice on what careers to keep in mind. I have spent some time contemplating what is available, but have yet to find that *ideal* position.

Quick background: I have a BA in mathematics and others would likely describe me as hard working, intuitive, technical, and outgoing, but not charismatic. My first priority would be to my family, so I am not looking for a career that would consistently demand traveling or more than 40-45 hours a week. I enjoy coding and have found myself losing entire days while lost in trying to perfect a specific project (I have taught myself python, vba, r, and stata - I have dabbled in matlab, but by no means am proficient). However, I love interacting with people and do not wish to be behind a screen 8 hours a day.

0,1421858999.0,"A little background info:

I am a college student that is investing using an online stock trading game (marketwatch). The game started in early November and my strategy so far has been to invest in companies that will have their earnings released within the next week, eventually selling a day or two after earnings have been released. I haven't invested in just any companies releasing earnings; I will invest in companies in which I have seen substantial growth over the quarter. For example, I have experienced incredible returns by investing in GPRO, NFLX, AVGO. etc. My portfolio value at day 1 was $1 million, and since then, I have made 85 trades and have returned 177% during the last few months (Portfolio value today = $2.7 million).

0,1363982716.0,"Question for the more quantitative folks here - I know there are some PhDs around.

I work for what could be generally described as a value-oriented, global equity long/short fund. We are looking at a private investment (to be public in the next 5 years) and are estimating cost of equity capital. We like to use the market-derived capital pricing model (MCPM) as a backup for CAPM or other models (this is not meant to be a debate about the MCPM, but for more details, see [here](http://www.cosinconsulting.com.br/WebSite/artigos/What_is_your_real_cost_of_capital.pdf)).

One of the primary inputs to the MCPM is volatility. However, as this investment in particular is private we lack a volatility input, although we have several good public market proxies. In this case the expected leverage of the investment in question is higher than the market proxies. **Is there a reasonable method for estimating the volatility of the equity of this firm, given the public market proxies?**

From a quick read, it looks as though B-S-M worked on this and viewed the equity volatility as a function of firm value volatility and leverage, where the volatility of debt is assumed to be zero, i.e. firm value volatility = (debt / firm value) * debt volatility + (equity / firm value) * equity volatility, simplifying to equity volatility = (firm value / equity) * firm value volatility.

Curious if we are thinking about this the correct way and if there are any other methods. Thanks.",BR

0,1391640861.0,"Hello, 



Like most people with some financial experience will know net debt and EBITDA are the two variables of one the most populair credit indicators being EBITDA/Net Debt. I understand what the two mean and feel like I am capable of calculating both values. However, when I consult a typical credit rating report from a rating institution and I check their values for the EBITDA and Net Debt of a particular firm, I rarely am capable of capable of calculating the same value using the company's financial reports. 



This is very frustrating and I am unable to find out myself what I'm doing wrong. I kind of get the feeling that if you would ask 5 top financial analysts to calculate these two variables on an identical set of data, you would get 5 different answers. Obviously it is more likely that I as a beginner am doing something wrong :)... The values I find are never a huge difference but always a significant difference that makes it clear I am not doing the same calculation.



Can anyone possibly try to explain what I might be doing wrong?



I simply calculate EBITDA by taking the EBIT and adding depreciation & amortization to it. Net debt I calculate by adding all the financial debt and distracting the cash equivalents from it. Is this too simplistic of a calculation? If anyone has any valuable articles/research on the matter or a valuable explanation to why I am getting different values than these rating agencies report, please explain :).

0,1488917861.0,"I've noticed throughout my years in business school that many students struggle with making assumptions.  I'm not sure if this is a prevalent issue (which is kinda why I'm here) but in my experience, the idea of making an assumption **based in reality** is almost staggering to people.  

TLDR AT THE BOTTOM...

I took one class which involved creating pro formas with projections for a rolling 4 year period.  While making these projections, we made assumptions based on sales (the 'business' was a computer company in the early years of consumer PCs).  So we did things from buying a factory (and managing factory capacity) to R&D to marketing.  All of these inputs were then put into a simulation program which 'judged' the efficacy of our inputs (advertising, capacity, production of different computers, sales tactics, # of employees, basically every aspect of a fully vertically integrated computer company).

The assumptions that some of my group members wanted to make were, to be blunt, pretty cringey.  I'll cut them slack on the first one since we had no historical data, but when we arrived in the 3rd-4th periods, people still had no idea what to do.  Manufacturing had 'decent' data on sales growth and whatnot and she would just insist on raising capacity by an arbitrary number.  That's essentially what it boiled down into.  People wanting to make assumptions based on arbitrary bases.  

I suggested we do a 'test period' where we make calculated moves and see how that affects our bottom line, basically to feel out the simulation and to see how the inputs would affect the output.  They were basically confused as to why we'd want to do that and basically showed no understanding of a computer program/its input-output style of logic.

So all of this culminated into horrible pro forma projections.  We'd base sales off of nothing and just assume that they'd increase by 20% every period, or some other arbitrary amount.  No one had any idea how to create good and realistic assumptions.  We'd talk about R&D and no one even thought about just looking up the prices of different R&D ventures (prices were listed per R&D upgrade) to see how much we'd spend based on what kinds of things we wanted.  Instead, they'd rather 'budget' a $10M expense for it in one year, when we could literally just see what upgrades we wanted and how much that'd cost.  AKA basing their assumptions off of nothing.

I don't have experience working with professionals on this too much.  I can tell teachers and whatnot who have done this for years often cover all the bases when they speak and they talk like they know how pro formas affect different line items and whatnot.  They display extensive knowledge of how changes can affect different areas of financial statements.  My current finance teacher with a PhD in math is a good example of this.  He recognizes that if you increase sales over a period of time, you need the infrastructure/capacity to handle it, how the increases in the capacity affect the bottom line, the new employees required to handle the increased capacity (unless you replace labor with capital).  Etc etc.  It's hard to really explain but it's very noticeable when talking to him that he really understands whats going on with financial statements and how 1 change can affect more than 1 other line item.

Contrast that to a student (and yes, my professor has obviously been doing it much longer) but it's alarming how little people can accomplish when they aren't given flat out what happens and how it affects everything.  In the same vein, many students cannot properly do a sensitivity analysis, where they make assumptions about the future based on differing levels of activity and how it affects the bottom line.  Many, without guidance, cannot simply assume that you'd want maybe 3 different environments, 1 with low demand, 1 with normal demand, 1 with extraordinary demand (obviously you could get much more in depth).  Or that you'd want to obviously account for necessary increases in capacity if you want to be able to handle the increase in demand/sales.  

It's hard to articulate properly but what I've boiled it down to is an inability to apply logic.  The same thing happens when you give someone a problem with no instructions.  They have no idea where to begin or what to do.  

If there is anyone here, such as teachers or recruiters, who regularly come into contact with young students/professionals who are entering the work force, have you noticed this 'phenomenon'?  I don't like to go off personal experience too much but it's almost universal at my school that students have trouble dealing with making assumptions and applying it to pro forma projections.  

Which is why I've been thinking about creating a 'training program' designed to help students go through the process of making assumptions about the future and seeing the outcome based on their assumptions.  The point isn't to develop people's 'future telling' abilities but more nuanced than that--to help people apply logic and help them go through the process of understanding a scenario and what the goals are, what the ramifications are for certain decisions, etc.  I know it's a vague concept but I do have a creative way of designing this training program in mind, but I want to know if it's something that would really be necessary or not.  I would obviously program it myself and my programming background has actually helped me a lot in finance, since I look at a pro forma basically like an extensively programmed Excel spreadsheet/a general program that accepts inputs and spits out an output based on an underlying function.

Any ideas or thoughts?

Tl;dr:  I've noticed students suck at making assumptions/applying logic so I've been thinking about creating a program to help 'train' students to think in the way a business executive would who is planning for the future.  Being able to make proper assumptions is pivotal in the planning aspect of running a business and it's often why businesses are so successful--because they always have a plan for any circumstance/situation that might arise.  And this plan is helpful because they know, today, if something happens in the future, what they must do, how it will affect their pro formas, and what it could mean for the company.  And it works because it's realistic and accounts for the whole machine that a business is.  They understand that it's an intricate machine with cogs that turn and, in turn, make other cogs spin. I've noticed a lot of students struggle with this process and I've been thinking about creating a program to help people think through the process.  

EDIT:  Also, are there any similar programs you guys have seen and your opinions on them if you've tried them before.  

To bring this full circle, the whole point is to understand business better and to be able to make better business decisions using better data.  So it'd all focus on financial statements and would be from the perspective of a business/from a business perspective, not so much other fields).

And please excuse the hodge podge anecdote, it was simply to demonstrate the kind of thinking I've seen from other people and how it contributes to an overall lack of understanding.  The simulation we used in that class is what I'd model my training program off of but with many improvements.  So the one being trained would probably act from the perspective of a business owner/CFO.

0,1448668780.0,"So, lets say we have a 70 year old mining company and an IT startup, the obvious differences in the statements Id reckon would be:

Income statement:
High sales and COGS for mining seeing as it is mature but very capital intensive, whereas the it startups probably has low/none sales and good margins (ie low COGS).

R&D is probably higher for IT because it is in a very inovative environment but they probably have low General & Admin because of not too many employees or offices. Depreciation is high in mining because of being very capital intensive as opposed to the IT company.

Balance Sheet:
ALOT of cash for mining because of the need of quick money to pay debt and/or finance new investments whereas a IT startup might be very low on cash and rely totally on equity/debt issuance. Inventory is probably higher in mining because IT is a service moreso than a product. PP&E and long term assets is probably higher in mining whereas intangibles is higher in IT. Debt is definitely higher in mining because being capital intensive means their capital structure needs to be such that they have access - and actively use - cheap(er) ways of financing operations.  At the same time, an IT startup has no/low assets such that it cant/wont have a lot of debt.

Not sure if this is a naive question or a loaded question, but I'm having a hard time understanding how interest rates affect the profits of different financial institutions. I understand that the banking industry is most affected by things like credit risk and interest rate risk, but still can't make the complete connection.

Do higher interest rates increase the number of defaults? Do banks overall prefer lower or higher interest rates or are they indifferent and would prefer stability?

E.g. mREITs can extend out more loans in times of low interest rate but during periods of low interest rates, there's less prepayment risk and their cash flows from MBSes are more secure",COF

0,1448920561.0,"    Here is the story I have friends who own taxi medallions in Chicago. Many of them bought their medallions at the time of right when the housing bubble about to burst in the country (U.S)(2007,2008,2009). The interesting parts of the idea of buying medallions were it was easy to finance or take a loan from the big banks and many other institutional investors without making or any down payments. As we all know what is happening in the life cycle of taxi industry and many other transportation businesses in general (Uber, Lyft effect), the big challenge is coming down to the people who bought medallions, and as well as who helped them to buy it. The price of medallions dropped down drastically which is a high risk for investors and individuals who own it. 
     
   The edge of the story is that in one side there are individuals who bought the medallions using investor’s money for the sake of gaining some value at the future date. On the other side, there are investors who lend money looking to gain, make profits on interest rates that they lend out the initial investment (start-up money)( again I don’t know the other interests of lending for medallions).
     
   Now the real headache is that the borrower (individual medallion owners) are struggling to pay off their debt (borrowed money from banks) or they still have payments to make for the next X amount of years while the price of the medallions are not worth that much after all.
    
    I think this scenario is very close to the scenario we had in 2008. Where the housing bubble; at first price moved upward, lack of bank’s credit check, lack of pricing model, unbalanced income levels and so on. The relationship to the medallion owners is the same; they thought buying a medallion is a good investment for the future, they made enough money at the time of buying it but not now,  the prices of the medallions dropped down a lot, and no buyers at the market at this time, and many other similar reasons. And its looks like a Medallion bubble to me (what do you say?). 
    
      Yes, it may not effect to every one of us, but if you or someone you know invested using institutional investors just don’t forget to check their portfolio and understand for what they have invested. If there were any investments made related to any sort of transportation, yes I say one more time transportation industry, please be on it and get rid of off it. Oh maybe it’s late for some of you, but many other’s this is a time to make changes. 
    
     Finally, the reason I am bothering to write about it, is that let us brainstorm little bit(find solution), it may be helpful to someone who is having down time. I have put some questions, and encourage everyone (professors, lawyers, students, investors, individuals, taxi drivers, uber drivers, dogs, cats…everyone) to write their thoughts related to this matter. 

      What is the best scenario in the place of medallion owner? (Yes they are going to drive for Uber)
      What should lenders have to do in order to get their money back? (The money the lend to borrowers)
       Is government, city, banks, SEC or anyone who has the authority to make changes will involve in the scenario?
       If either party's of the agreement (borrowers vs. lenders) have thoughts about default, who should start first? And what are the costs/benefits?
        And ask you to participate, write questions/answers.


I also apologize for those who look for grammatical, wording, in proper word usage..etc mistakes that I made while writing this up. Sorry, Hope you get my idea, and what I am trying to explain (if not, nothing I can do to help you better understand me )

I'm currently working on my bachelor dissertation on the vix index and its derivatives and in my research I found that rolling short term vix futures could be used as a hedge tool for a portfolio strongly correlated with the sp500. I'd like to test this hypothesis over the last ten years (and I can easily find all the necessary data), but I don't really know how to compute it efficiently using excel:I know how a future work of course, but I don't have the time to calculate ""manually"" every single return or loss each month for 10 years. 

Does anyone know a fast efficient way to calculate the returns of such large amount of futures? You would really help a young student currently drowning in data

(sorry if this post ""don't english very good"", it's not my first language)

TL:DR how do I calculate returns of 10 years of monthly futures without spending 20 hours doing so?

EDIT: the problem is also that there isn't a ""single"" future price for each month: [on the cboe site](http://cfe.cboe.com/data/historicaldata.aspx) you can see how the historical prices are organized: basicaly there is a different excel file for each months futures are supposed to expire [the jan 17 one looks like this for example](https://gyazo.com/975279de186d79e1640d1440d377ca4f)",CBOE

What I'm getting from this is that the settlement value is the opening price for the S&P 500 index on the 3rd Friday of the month.

Aren't they supposed to be inversely correlated? The contract is mean reverting, so even if the baseline volatility is lower,  it doesn't make sense that is would fall in such a manner, unless it were being manipulated somehow.

0,1437849372.0,"Hi there,

As the title says, I'm practicing making an operating model and valuation through DCF analysis on that. I was wondering if someone could review it and give me some thoughts about it. I also have a few specific questions. As of yet this is so far my best one I've done but there are still some problems I can't seem to solve. 

So the company in question is Lululemon Athletica. I built the model from the 2015 and 2014 annual reports. I made the income statement first then made a framework for the cash flows, did the depreciation and working capital tables afterwards so I could input those onto cash flows and then applied the changes in CF to the balance sheet. 

Dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/nfygl8hnqc7tkcy/LULU.xlsx?dl=0

So the following were some things I was wondering about. 

1. Are there any glaring issues in usability or accounting rules in my model?

I've been reading two introductory books on building financial models, ""Building Financial Models"" by Tjia and ""Financial Modeling and Valuation"" by Pignataro.  

2. I've found that Pignataro's method of building from cash flows first a lot more intuitive however Tjia argues for building the balance sheet first. Pignataro makes the argument that  doing the cash flows first makes the process more intuitive and less error prone but some reviewers of the book dislike this saying that it is in-fact more error prone and not standard procedure.  What are the pros and cons of the two approaches?

3. Going from the second question, Tjia seems to stress pretty heavily about using plug accounts such as an ""excess cash"" or ""necessary to finance"" line to balance. I find this pretty sloppy as it tends to ignore the problem of balancing altogether. Could someone comment about this?

4. For the future, how do you set up a cash flow statement? For this valuation, most of the accounts affected are pretty clear. However there were still a couple of items that I didn't know what to do with such as Sales Tax collected, Stock-based compensation and De-recognition of Gift Cards. Overall I decided to replace these and put into a simpler changes in account form. 

5. Could someone take a look at the balance sheet difference? I traced every account balance change back to the cash flow statement but I still couldn't find anything. It actually seems as though each cash flow statement record is present within the balance sheet and the difference is ""just there"" somehow. I didn't notice any double counting, but I'll be doing more checks after making this post as well.

Edit: Fixed the balancing issue. As it turns out, the depreciation table generates a differed tax liability firstly, I did correctly count it as a non-cash expense but ""double counted"" by making putting what would be the liability into the differed tax assets. I didn't consider to multiply my balance sheet differences by two to see if there were any sign flip issues.",CF

Ben Toucan, owner of the Aspen Restaurant, wants to determine the present value of his investment. The Aspen Restaurant is currently in the development stage but Toucan hopes to “begin” operations early next year. After-tax cash flows during the next five years are expected to be as follows: 

Year 1	0

Year 2	0

Year 3	0

Year 4	$2.5 millions

Year 5	$3 millions

Cash inflows are expected to be $3.18 million in year 6 and are expected to to grow at a 6% annual rate thereafter. Assuming that venture investors often use different discount rates when valuing ventures at various stages of their life cycles. For example, target discount rates by life cycle stage are: development stage 50%, start-up stage 40%, survival stage 35% and early rapid-growth stage 30%. As ventures move from their late rapid-growth stages and into their maturity stages, a 20% discount rate is often used.

a-	Determine the Aspen Restaurant’s terminal or horizon value at the end of five years, assuming the venture will be entering its maturity stage. (2 marks)

b-	What is the present value of the Aspen Restaurant, assuming that it is a development-stage venture? (2 marks)


I am interested more in the present value and used the Equation (Because CF in years 1-3 is 0 I won't include them) :

Year 5: (3,000,000 + (3,180,000/**(.5**-.06)) / 1.5^5 = $1,346,792

a negative [2] should, in theory, incentive banks to lend money to businesses instead of parking it at the CB, hence stimulating the economy, but has never been done before and its long term effects are unknown.

I'm someone from a non-financial background who is unable to get my head around how monetary policy works in practice. I can't really narrow my confusion down to one particular question, so I've just listed a few musings in the hope that someone can point me in the right direction :)

1. Let's say the central bank sets its base rate as 5%. What is to stop banks lending at say 4% or 6%?
2. Does the central bank have any legislative power over the interest rates banks offer to each other / depositors? *(e.g. it can prevent banks from deviating from the base rate by more than x%)*
3. And/or might it seek to align those rates with the CB's base rate by some kind of arbitrage mechanism? *(e.g. if a particular bank is lending at 4%, the CB could borrow at 4% until supply and demand forced the bank to raise its rate towards 5%)*
4. Does all of this vary by country? For example I'm in the UK, so for all I know the bank of england may do things in a different way to the fed.

Every now and then I compare different stocks to one another, and I often see that unrelated stocks have the same small-scale fluctuations. The noise in the market seems to be highly correlated. For example, compare the Dow to IBM:
https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1338443739571&chddm=25415&chls=IntervalBasedLine&cmpto=NYSE:IBM&cmptdms=0&q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&ntsp=0

All of the tiny little spikes in the IBM stock are present in the Dow (or Intel, or a bunch of other stocks), but I don't see how this is possible, or what it means, or why it happens.

After becoming a contracted trader (after 6 months to 2 years of training) I will receive 0 salary and a 50/50 split on my gains.  I will have to fill up an account with the company of $50,000 dollars: half of my 50/50 split will go to filling this account which will deplete when I take a loss (losses will come 50% out of my account and 50% out of the companies account).

Is it simply that investors will have no confidence and will not buy until the old debt is settled, or are there legal rules that prevent new issues?

Shrink and swim strategy leaves the City without a global investment bank, writes Philip Augar 

he final curtain is about to come down on one of the City’s of London’s longest running shows. Ever since Big Bang in 1986, when deregulation opened up access to securities markets, the attempts of British banks to compete with the leading Wall Street houses have created a compelling spectacle full of big bets, ruined reputations, and fortunes won and lost. But comments last week from John Mc­Farlane, Barclays’ chairman, suggest that the play is finally moving to a smaller theatre.

“When you look at the dominant investment banks, they are North American” said Mr McFarlane. “They have the scale that we no longer have to be global so we are going to have to focus.” It was a devastating comment from the head of the one British institution in the investment banking big league. Is he right and if so what does that mean for Barclays and the City?

What to do about investment banking is a question that has troubled Barclays ever since 1983, the year Timothy Bevan, a great-grandson of the first chairman, signed off on a proposal to buy and build an investment bank. It proved to be harder than it looked for Barclays and the other British groups trying to muscle in on Wall Street. The Americans had capital, experienced management and a hugely profitable home market. They powered into London, grabbed the biggest deals, hired many of the best bankers and squeezed margins. Globally aspiring UK investment banks were forced to give up.Barclays was the last one standing until it sold its equities and corporate finance business in 1998.

But Barclays and investment banking were not quite done. Under the American Bob Diamond, it cleverly worked its way back into the business, culminating in the acquisition of Lehman’s US business in 2008. It secured and indeed retains a seat at Wall Street’s top table.

Yet just as Barclays sat down, others got up to leave. Stringent regulations after the crisis forced banks to conserve capital and cut unprofitable businesses. Clients who had once preferred to buy products from full-service institutions came to accept that specialists have a role to play. The fashionable investment-banking model has become the slimmed down, return on assets-focused version exemplified by the likes of UBS rather than that of the monsters that once gobbled up market share and capital. Only a handful of global players remain.

The “shrink-and-swim” strategy implied by Barclays last week is thus perfectly credible. It starts from a position of strength; pruning is easier than growing; and investment banking-light is a proposition shareholders, clients and staff find credible today.

Yet Barclays’ decision to refocus has consequences for the City. It would leave the UK without a global competitor — just as it was between 1998, when the company last withdrew from full-service investment banking, and 2008 when it went back in.

Last time it seemed superficially not to matter. London flourished as a global financial services capital. Employees, clients and regulators grew used to the idea that head office was in New York; and jubilant bankers derided the idea of national identity in the fast and fluid world of global finance.

The banking crisis gave cause for second thoughts about this Panglossian idea. By adopting US-style investment banking, the City had thrown away its cherished traditions of prudence and patience, and left the UK unhealthily exposed to a business it did not understand. What happened in the next decade was that the authorities stood back and lost control.

The presence of Barclays Capital in the middle of the global stage offered a brief period of knowledge and influence. Its absence will leave the UK more vulnerable.

The writer is a former banker who has written extensively about the City and is working at present on a book about Barclays ",CMS

0,1329333674.0,"Hey Guys,

So I am about a year or two away from my (hopeful) push to the Capital Markets/IB portion of the bank I work for. As of now I am a non-market analyst in the sales department (Reporting). 

About me:
25 years old (well, shortly anyway),
Graduate of a non-top tier private school (It is ranked in top 120),
Graduated with a business degree with a below average GPA.
Recently landed above mentioned bank job through networking.

Since coming to this job, I have fallen in love with finance, and would like to make the switch to our CM/IB division. I know the hurdles I face, I know the low probability, I am up for the challenge anyway.

In December I will be taking the CFA Level 1. Began briefly studying and will rank it up steadily as I approach the date.

My bank advertises to recent grads that it requires knowledge of VBA. This is something else I will read on prior to contacting or setting up an interview. I actually am not worried on my ability to learn it.

Now, my bank also advertises that they don't require you to approach the interview with a specialty, but rather understand the different specialties of IBs. The position I am hoping to apply for is Sales/Trading Analyst. The other analyst position that could potentially be a better earning career is the Investment & Corporate Banking Analyst, but it is a 3 year tenure with expectation to approach full time B school afterwards (I worry of not getting into a good one, nor how I would afford to go back to full time school). So it seemst he Sales/Trading might be more geared for me.

So where is my question? I appologize for the long block of text. I was curious what other educational materials should I approach prior to contact/interview. As stated, I will (hopefully) be CFA level 1, and familiar with VBA. Many state you should have a strong understand of financial modeling prior to any IB interview.

I'm a recent BCom graduate and have been working at a bank as an Account Manager (small business and retail) for less than a year but, while I enjoy working there, I'm motivated to continue my career development. The most enjoyable aspects of my job are (1) assessing risk in client organizations through analysis of client business plans and (2) meeting entrepreneurs, learning about their businesses and offering input wherever warranted.

Naturally, I'd like to work in business development consulting but am also interested in working for a VC firm (possibly as an analyst). 

Is there a designation that would open up some of the right doors for me?

Would being an analyst result in endless number crunching or is there some exposure to market research, process analysis, qualitative analysis, etc.?

A few years ago I created my own startup, went through a top accelerator (Techstars), and ultimately shutdown the business. Now I've onboarded with a more promising startup handling their Operations and Finance.


Currently, I am enjoying the financial aspects of the business - I find myself focusing on the FP&A and interacting with our current investors; I am brought into high-level meetings to discuss the health of our company and its strategies. 


From a career perspective, I'd like to either become a CFO or potentially work in Venture Capital. In order to increase my chances, I've considered both the CFA and CMA. 

**Questions:**


* I assume the CMA would be best fit for a CFO position, whereas the CFA certification would benefit VCs more, correct?


* I am already in the industry I am most interested in (seed/growth stage startups). Would my current experience pass for the Work Experience that is required by the CMA and CFA? Or do I have to leave the startup world and work with an accounting firm?",CMA

Additionally I am taking VBA courses at the University of Calgary (where I live). I have a BA Economics (2011), experience in various rolls in the energy industry through summer jobs, solid references. 

I am not a fan of what I'm doing right now. I don't care how hard I have to work, I want to be doing something more prestigious, and higher paying (working for a minor consultancy firm the pay is so-so - if I stuck with this for 10 years I could be doing very well as an independent consultant but it's bloody uninteresting). I want to be in an economic decision making position and am considering doing my MBA in the next 5-7 years.

Basically I've spent the last four years on the premed track, graduating from UCLA with a BS in Neuroscience. It's been fine and I got a good score on the MCAT but there's been one issue that's been nagging at me for a few years now I have been drawn to is finance. Particularly financial analysis. I'm really starting to think that it's my calling for the following reasons:


1) For really no reason at all since my second year in college I've harbored an unusual interest in how to value common stocks, then preferred stocks, then bonds, then options, then REITS, and so on. 


2) The only books I've read since high school are the Intelligent Investor, the Intelligent Asset Allocator, Common stocks and Uncommon profits, The Snowball Effect, Security Analysis 1962 ed (like half, that shit is huge), The Essays of Warren E. Buffet, etc. 


3) Warren Buffet is my motherfucking hero (with Munger as his kickass sidekick). 


4) The only income I've ever had was a high school job at Round Table Pizza, but I've already endlessly planned and perfected how I am going to save for retirement. Fuck yea Roth IRAs.


5) Finding companies with high ROE, ROIC, and low P/B, P/E ratios literally gives me a boner (alright just figuratively)


6) I don't even care what I'm ultimately paid as long as I can sift through balance sheets all day and have enough money left over after living expenses to allocate some capitol of my own.




So what I ask of you r/finance is: Am I just a starry-eyed noob who's romanticizing finance because I haven't had any true exposure to the industry yet? Or should I stop dicking around and DO something about it? CFA level 1? Am I even qualified to search for internships?

We're stable enough to make the payments, but damn, almost $500/month for college loans hurts. That's money that I keep thinking could go into babygirl's college savings, or our retirement, or etc. 

So...I have heard rumblings from friends and family that college loan consolidation programs - and government college loan debt reduction programs - exist and are available. However, I am usually kinda gunshy about dipping my feet into the finance whirlpool, but I feel like I'm at a point where it really makes sense that I cut down this laaaarge chunk of our monthly payments.

I've google-searched and found a ton of links on college loan consolidation. Looks like there are programs through several banks, including Wells Fargo. I found the government site on [loan consolidation services](https://loanconsolidation.ed.gov/AppEntry/apply-online/appindex.jsp) but I'm uncertain if that's something where it's a government service that helps you find the right private bank to handle your loan or what.

0,1389631052.0,"* In '97, Bill Gates helped his old frenemy, Steve Jobs, by purchasing 
$150M of AAPL stocks. Here are my questions about this transactions. 

* Why couldn't AAPL allow the general public to buy $150M worth of 
non-voting shares, but instead he went to only one entity - MSFT - for 
this financial lifeline? This is pricing discrimination, because our 
price is $INFINITY and MSFT's price was $150M. 

* When MSFT bought $150M worth of AAPL shares in '97, did they buy 
from the secondary market or did they buy from a new offering? These 
shares were non-voting anyways. 

* Why didn't AAPL issue$150M worth of high-yielding bonds to MSFT? 
This would have had more stability, paid a higher-than-normal yield, 
would have been tax favorable to AAPL, and they are also a non-voting 
investment in MSFT. 

* How does a company ""issue shares towards prosperity""? This 
dilutes EPS and just doesn't make sense to me. This is what doesn't 
make sense specifically: If a distressed company issues $100M of 
shares, then that distressed company's new business model is to simply 
issue shares and some C-level executives (i.e. CEO, COO, etc.) and i- 
Bankers get rich. But the new shareholders lose value over time. Their 
investment in a distressed company is bad. How do you issue your way 
to prosperity?

Context:  My school is doing a trading competition, they take a random 3 mo of stock prices and use black scholes to generate option prices.  They then +/- a random variable with mean 0 to stock & option prices to add noise and add/subtract another well behaved random variable to determine the bid-ask spread.  Transaction costs are fixed and are 0.015 or 0.025 of total transaction value depending on what it is (stock vs option, long vs short).  

My idea is that since there is a lot of random noise thrown into prices, if the random variables shift prices favorably enough, there could be an arbitrage opportunity but I haven't been able to figure out the best way to test this.  

What I've been doing so far with a set of test data my professor generated, is testing PCP with mid prices for two dates ie: 4/7/2014 and 4/11/2014.  If there is a spread in PCP and it converges within this range, I then run the trades  and unwind them factoring in transaction costs (bid/ask spread & transaction coefficients) to see if it is profitable overall.  Unfortunately, this doing/unwinding the trades is very time consuming and I have yet to automate it with vba code.  I was wondering if there is a metric I can look that can help me make this decision faster?  I was thinking maybe doing something that looks at the PCP spread without transaction costs and comparing it to the transaction costs as a % of the spread but I have not been able to figure out the math & logic behind this.

0,1342541736.0,"A friend who works in real estate recently tried to sell me on how IUL (indexed universal life) is the greatest thing ever.  The plan they are on is indexed to the SP500, they get downside protection in that their minimum gain/loss in a year is 0%, but they also have upside capped at I believe 32%.  This 32% cap seems way too high to me, which means that the plan must be incredibly expensive.  However, the acquaintance could tell me nothing about the expense ratio of the plan - the management fees, etc. When he was sold the policy he either glossed over at the cost or it wasn't clearly communicated.  He says it's particularly useful for people in real estate because you can borrow against the policy, flip a property, and extract the gain prior to retirement.  I tried reading up on it at various insurance company websites, but the level of detail they provide is very limited, probably because it is illegal to advertise insurance products as investment vehicles.

I would like to be clear on how exactly, if at all, an IUL policy can be better from an investment perspective than say a 401k, IRA, or a simple traditional investment portfolio with no tax advantage.

1) Obviously no one is going to offer downside protection without requiring compensation, and my guess is that this particular feature is geared towards people who are either highly risk averse or gain an unusual amount of utility from never having to see a negative number in their annual statement.  My question is what sort of fees/expenses have people seen in these kind of policies?

2) What exactly are the tax advantages?  From what I've read, the cash value is not taxed on the back-end, but you pay into the plan after taxes.  Obviously everyone who understands the time value of money prefers a dollar today to a dollar tomorrow, all else equal.  So what exactly is the advantage here?  Are the gains also tax-free on the back-end?  How can you extract these gains before death?

3) Similar to #2, how does the borrowing aspect work exactly?  How is this different from just taking money out of your non-retirement savings and promising to pay yourself back x%?  To me this just seems like forced savings.  This idea of ""be your own bank"" just seems like a way for people who are bad with money to force themselves to save, with the insurance company as a middle man taking x% off the top.  Again, how is this different than investing all your money in a traditional portfolio and extracting money from it as you need it for other investment opportunities?

4) My understanding of insurance is limited to the perspective from investment theory.  Basically that, due to risk aversion and the shape of the utility curve, people are willing to pay for insurance even though it has negative expected value.  But this should only be to a certain extent unless someone is infinitely risk averse.  Since death is inevitable I don't understand how it makes sense to insure yourself through old age.  Is this mainly used as a method for wealthy people to pass on an inheritance without it being taxed?  Do you have to keep your IUL policy active your entire life?  Can your premiums, fees, etc. ever change and if you refuse to pay the higher costs can your plan be canceled?  Does it somehow also make sense for low- to middle-income families?",COST

I'm working on a presentation on banking regulation and I came across this article that states that the cost of lending increases with increased regulation. 


Here's the quote I'm confused about. 


*INSEAD Professor of Banking and Finance Jean Dermine cautions some of the proposed regulations are going too far. In a new white paper entitled ""Banking regulations after the global financial crisis, good intentions and unintended evil"", he says these regulations may safeguard banks from future meltdowns but the economy could suffer because the supply of loans would be severely curtailed. In other words, the new banking regulations threaten to keep too much money in the vaults and not enough in the economy. ""This is an overreaction,"" Dermine told INSEAD Knowledge, ""because we should not forget that banks are extremely useful in the real economy, to finance lending to consumers and small and medium-sized companies. If you come with stringent regulations, **the cost of lending is going to go up tremendously**. The cost of bank loans to small firms will increase.""*


Can anyone kindly explain why the cost of lending would increase? I'm guessing it's because since banks would be required to keep more in reserves, they are going to have less capital to lend out - thus increasing the bank's required return, which would be the interest rate. If banks had more money to ""play around with"" they would be able to accept lower returns (issue loans at lower rates) and would be able to lend more funds.


So, decreased supply of loan-able funds = higher interest rate, right?


But how is this a cost to the bank? Is it that less in the quantity of loans (which would be an asset to the bank) means less earnings?


I'm confused. Please help.

Customer group B always pays off their balance on time, and our profit on them is entirely derived from an interchange fee equaling 1.5% of their total yearly transaction value.  
The first part of this case involved deriving the estimated profit for a customer from group A. It was a set of fairly straightforward calculations, and the result was that the estimated profit from customer A was $260.  
The second part of the case was where I fell on my ass. The main question to be answered for this second part of the case was ""What is the total yearly value of transactions needed in order for customer B to produce that same $260 profit."" Easy, I thought. Just divide $260 by the 1.5% interchange fee we collect and we get...$17,333.33(repeating)? Immediately I knew this was almost surely wrong, as every other number in every other case they had given me had worked out to very clean even numbers. ""Alright, I've likely overlooked something here. Let me take a look back at the information we have and see if I've missed something.""  
Lo and behold, I had. There is a 4% cost of funds for the company on balances held by customers. While customer B pays off their balance when the statement comes due, we still have to account for that 4% cost of funds during the period they are spending until they pay it off.  
My thought at that point was to divide .04 by 12 giving us .003333 and subtract that from .015. Then dividing $260 by .01166667 I got an even uglier $22,285.7136(infinitely continuing string of decimals). I was stumped and still am.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982. The Reagan Administration, in their ever-prescient wisdom, enacted SEC Rule 10b-18, creating a safe harbor whereby corporations could buy back their own stocks. This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

4) How do you feel about Donald Trump? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZ5e94QnWk",DRI

I'm growing increasingly concerned with my prospects upon graduation. Public Accounting firms thought I was too interested in Finance by my club/internship experiences (sometimes they even flat out said it during the interview) and the only finance positions our university has listed through our career site are sales-oriented (I picked up accounting to avoid that fate).

**1st Update:** Guys I just want to thank you all for your advice. It's been a rough week (3 rejections on Monday to start the week off) and I just needed my perspective to be brought back to earth. You guys are wonderful and I appreciate all forms of advice, no matter how dry/realistic; I know the market a bit better than most college grads but clearly stress is blinding my view at the moment. 

**2nd Update:** I think you guys are getting hung up on the idea that I don't want to do sales because I don't want interaction. I don't want to do sales because I don't think it's an admirable profession. 

**3rd Update:** I guess I should clarify this because I feel like there's been some miscommunication. When I say I don't want to work in sales, I'm talking about selling life insurance for a company like Northwest Mutual. I'd kill for a S&T job with a BB firm. I think we can all agree those roles are worlds apart from each other. 

**Final Update:** Thanks again to everyone that provided meaningful feedback that I can use moving forward. I always welcome criticism so long as it's constructive and I can take something from it.

0,1421158197.0,"By Deborah Lawrence
Executive Director, Energy Policy Forum

Risk mitigation is a primary driver in any business. When examining risk factors associated with oil sands extraction there are various vulnerabilities. Taken singularly, none appears to be insurmountable. Unfortunately, taken as a whole, the picture begins to change dramatically.

Each of the top ten oil sands companies have integrated operations such as conventional and unconventional production, refining and midstream assets in addition to their oil sands portfolios. While oil sands are considered long lived assets which could potentially produce for decades and bring stability to the producer's financials, the industry instead faces a number of challenges. Grant Ukrainetz, had this to say regarding oil sands in October, 2013:

""Capital cost pressures in the oil sands have tripled, operating costs in the oil sands at least doubled, we had a change in the oil sands royalty regime, we had greater environmental regulations, costs of compliance have increased, we had continued delays in pipelines that allow us to move products out to maximize revenue, (there is) negative public sentiment toward the oil sands, plus you have the emergence of other opportunities in the U.S. and elsewhere.”

While each company has seen growth or stability in oil sands production, price realizations have shrunk, operating expenditures have grown and margins have been squeezed.  Transportation bottlenecks have proved costly with new pipeline construction in limbo forcing operators to ship crude by rail. It is estimated that such shipping costs are ~$8/bbl or about 10% of realized prices. In other words, about 3 times the cost of shipping by pipeline.

Capital expenditure has exploded over the past three years but has produced little actual free cash flow. In fact, at seven of the top ten companies, free cash flow has been negative demonstrating a long term pattern of deterioration.

The same pattern can be seen in the junior oil sands producers as well. Consequently, capital expenditure is proving exceedingly challenging as the juniors have lesser ability to access the capital markets than do their larger peers. Further, policy was changed in 2012 which hampered foreign investment in oil sands. In order to protect Canadian oil resources from foreign control, the government banned foreign ownership. This dried up capital almost immediately for the juniors. Given that oil sands production is very capital intensive, ready access to large sums of money is needed. Canadian capital markets are simply not large enough to fund such production. Some foreign capital is necessary to exploit these assets making this a thorny issue for government officials.

Other problems have presented themselves as well. For instance, operating expense has grown over the past few years though the prices realized for bitumen and synthetic crude have dropped.

WCS blend differentials deteriorated from a discount to WTI of $17.10 in 2011 to $25.11 in 2013 further hampering margins. In 2012, when global crude prices dropped, Canadian E&P was hammered as corporate profits fell more than 50% to $7.1B, the lowest level seen since 1999. Oil sands production is heavily dependent upon high crude prices but WCS has consistently traded at a discount to WTI and Maya. This not anticipated to change. 

Given the inherent risks of potential production glut, high capital and operational expenditure and falling prices, margins would appear shaky at best. Coupling such margin constraints with transportation bottlenecks and exceedingly poor share performance, raises a reasonable argument that oil sands may not be the best place to park capital.

0,1437849372.0,"Hi there,

As the title says, I'm practicing making an operating model and valuation through DCF analysis on that. I was wondering if someone could review it and give me some thoughts about it. I also have a few specific questions. As of yet this is so far my best one I've done but there are still some problems I can't seem to solve. 

So the company in question is Lululemon Athletica. I built the model from the 2015 and 2014 annual reports. I made the income statement first then made a framework for the cash flows, did the depreciation and working capital tables afterwards so I could input those onto cash flows and then applied the changes in CF to the balance sheet. 

Dropbox:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/nfygl8hnqc7tkcy/LULU.xlsx?dl=0

So the following were some things I was wondering about. 

1. Are there any glaring issues in usability or accounting rules in my model?

I've been reading two introductory books on building financial models, ""Building Financial Models"" by Tjia and ""Financial Modeling and Valuation"" by Pignataro.  

2. I've found that Pignataro's method of building from cash flows first a lot more intuitive however Tjia argues for building the balance sheet first. Pignataro makes the argument that  doing the cash flows first makes the process more intuitive and less error prone but some reviewers of the book dislike this saying that it is in-fact more error prone and not standard procedure.  What are the pros and cons of the two approaches?

3. Going from the second question, Tjia seems to stress pretty heavily about using plug accounts such as an ""excess cash"" or ""necessary to finance"" line to balance. I find this pretty sloppy as it tends to ignore the problem of balancing altogether. Could someone comment about this?

4. For the future, how do you set up a cash flow statement? For this valuation, most of the accounts affected are pretty clear. However there were still a couple of items that I didn't know what to do with such as Sales Tax collected, Stock-based compensation and De-recognition of Gift Cards. Overall I decided to replace these and put into a simpler changes in account form. 

5. Could someone take a look at the balance sheet difference? I traced every account balance change back to the cash flow statement but I still couldn't find anything. It actually seems as though each cash flow statement record is present within the balance sheet and the difference is ""just there"" somehow. I didn't notice any double counting, but I'll be doing more checks after making this post as well.

Edit: Fixed the balancing issue. As it turns out, the depreciation table generates a differed tax liability firstly, I did correctly count it as a non-cash expense but ""double counted"" by making putting what would be the liability into the differed tax assets. I didn't consider to multiply my balance sheet differences by two to see if there were any sign flip issues.",DE

When I say I don't want to work in sales, I'm talking about selling life insurance for a company like Northwest Mutual. I'd kill for a S&T job with a BB firm. I think we can all agree those roles are worlds apart from each other. 

**Final Update:** Thanks again to everyone that provided meaningful feedback that I can use moving forward. I always welcome criticism so long as it's constructive and I can take something from it. Sorry if I seemed down; obviously I would never admit that I'm upset in front of someone from a prospective company. I appreciate the several ""cheer up"" comments, they are additionally appreciated.

I'm fine with giving cash a weight of 1 and long-term investments a weight of something less than 1, but simply choosing, say, 0.5 rubs me the wrong way unless I have some kind of empirical data that shows that in actual liquidation situations, long-term investments have a mean selling value for half the value listed on recent balance sheets (my academic background is in statistics; data is my friend).

The big hedge funds now have to get in because the highest performing hedge fund from last year was just announced and was the only one invested in bitcoin. So this year all the others will need to be in and that will be billions flowing into bitcoin for the first time. And they will be investing with other peoples money and people always invest other people's money faster than their own.

Up to now bitcoin has been driven by real people putting in their own real money.

The hedge fund flood will be totally different. Much faster influx and higher. Price pressure.

It COULD reach $600,000 in a month.  The rate of acceleration into bitcoin is getting faster. The exponent is increasing itself exponentially.

It did 10 x in 4 months but it did 4x in onemonth of that.

10 x times 10 x gets you to $100,000 then its only 6 x to gold market cap although things may temporarily slow at gold marketcap. However at that point it is still undervalued becuase the total currencies of the world will also be investing a portion of their holdings in bitcoin becuase bifcoin is both a wealth protector like gold AND a currency.

At that point it may take more time to intergrate as currency and not just have the goldbug type hedge money safety portion driving acceleration .

Like most people with some financial experience will know net debt and EBITDA are the two variables of one the most populair credit indicators being EBITDA/Net Debt. I understand what the two mean and feel like I am capable of calculating both values. However, when I consult a typical credit rating report from a rating institution and I check their values for the EBITDA and Net Debt of a particular firm, I rarely am capable of capable of calculating the same value using the company's financial reports. 



This is very frustrating and I am unable to find out myself what I'm doing wrong. I kind of get the feeling that if you would ask 5 top financial analysts to calculate these two variables on an identical set of data, you would get 5 different answers. Obviously it is more likely that I as a beginner am doing something wrong :)... The values I find are never a huge difference but always a significant difference that makes it clear I am not doing the same calculation.



Can anyone possibly try to explain what I might be doing wrong?



I simply calculate EBITDA by taking the EBIT and adding depreciation & amortization to it. Net debt I calculate by adding all the financial debt and distracting the cash equivalents from it. Is this too simplistic of a calculation? If anyone has any valuable articles/research on the matter or a valuable explanation to why I am getting different values than these rating agencies report, please explain :).

So the company uses their WACC primarily for asset appraisals, performance assessments (1 year, 3 year and 5 year), M&A proposals and stock repurchase decisions.. The question is to state what the underlying assumptions would be for these uses.

So far, for the uses of asset appraisals, M&A proposals and stock repurchase decisions, my assumptions would be are that values for the risk free rate and equity market risk premium should be as forward looking as the projected cash flows of the firm. Secondly is we should be using the target D/E ratio of the firm, not the current or past and finally we must be using market values of debt and equity..

For Performance assessments i assume that you would use backward looking data as you have all information available to you over the period that you are assessing.

1) I assume for the EBIT (1-T) part we exclude all financial and exceptional income? So for this particular profit and loss statement we take the gross margin and substract ""selling, general and administrative expenses"" and the ""tax provision""? Which would yield for 2013: 6778-3965-1168=1645. Correct?



2) For calculating the net working capital changes I feel really lost on what the correct calculation should be. Should I just use the values listed in the cash flow statement in changes in assets and liabilities excluding divestures, or should I calculate it myself using the balance sheet (and exclude cash, short-term debt and assets/liabilities held for sale)? Since I do not get the same values for those 2 calculations. Also, why are these values different? 



3) For D&A and capital expenditures, are the listed values in the cash flow statement the values that should be used generally (I understand exceptions can always be made for specific companies or industries, but generally speaking) ?

Are you ... I am sorry ... tired of winning? Anyway here is a story about how 1,000 is 5 percent of 20,000 but 10 percent of 10,000, which is another reason to be bored I guess.

How has it come to pass that on the evening news that we always see only stock indices? Why not bonds? 

It's plain to see that the amount in debt securities overwhelms the amounts of equity securities held. Debt securities also do not show quite the volatility of their equity counterparts. 

Sure, if you want to spread fear among the general population, show them plummeting stock prices but when most pension funds are likely put together with bonds, why make the problem worse? Why purposefully ruin the general sentiment about the market among the general public? It seems to me that this is actually counterproductive.

He lists other ""ticking time bombs"":

 * The faux U.S. real-estate recovery since 2012 looks to be faltering as interest rates rise and investors start to back off after price gains from renting and flipping look less attractive. We expect real estate to turn down again and to drop another 30% before this bubble has deflated.

 * China is losing control over its private-shadow banking sector, which continues to fuel the out-of-control real-estate bubble its government is trying to slow. Ironically, this is the very bubble it created in the first place with its over-investment in everything.

 * The southern Europe crisis will only worsen ahead, despite endless bailouts and European Central Bank (ECB) pledges to buy the bonds of failing nations. 

 * The Fed is increasingly in checkmate as rising growth in the economy will force it to taper and withdraw the stimulus crack… but if the economy continues to falter, it’ll become increasingly clear that the stimulus is no longer working, just like what we saw in Europe in 2012.

Please excuse the entry-level explanations, we all know how the bond market works here, but I'm at work and don't really have time to modify it right now. This was also written last Thursday, treasuries have moved even higher still since then.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982. The Reagan Administration, in their ever-prescient wisdom, enacted SEC Rule 10b-18, creating a safe harbor whereby corporations could buy back their own stocks. This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

Do we see these ""wildly inappropriate values"" in warrants or LEAPs or is it just in the 15-20 year put options sold by Berkshire (as described on [page 16 of the 2007 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2007ar/2007ar.pdf))

[exact quote from 2010 annual report [PDF], page 21](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2010ar/2010ar.pdf)

>**Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to long-dated options.** We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that the Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.

>We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is the accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be
accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an insurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of both their values and ours were the two[sic] far apart.

>Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that calculated by Black-Scholes, but we can’t come up with an exact figure – anymore than we can come up with a precise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t
bother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.

The ""absurd example"" is on [page 20 of the 2008 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2008ar/2008ar.pdf)

>So let’s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1 billion put option on the S&P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied volatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and dividend assumptions, we would find the “proper” Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.

>To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&P will be valued a century from now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only
2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher. Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of most of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about
175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.


>Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year period to be far less than 1%. But let’s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline – should one
occur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5 million ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).

>But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to invest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have been profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?
Let’s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay nothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities – that
is, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my assumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.

>The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion of volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around
in some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probabilityweighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote every day on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing quotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farm a century from now.)

The average investor believes the 2000 and 2008 and 2011 declines are/were temporary, and they are. But how temporary? It's been 12 years and we still are in decline if the dow is indexed in real US dollars. The dow only a few weeks ago was the same level it was in 2000, 2008, 2006, 2001, and 2010. A level which is measured in inflating dollars. Accounting for inflation we are at where we were in the early 90s and late 80s.

In recessions, as usual, investors realize they need to pull out into cash. More and more investors are realizing this is a lost decade or even a lost year or 4 years. They will want to step away for a few years. Then will quickly realize, or already knew, holding cash is just as bad of an investment. They will then turn to hedges against inflation, real assets, further devaluing the dollar. They will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value. Meanwhile, the fed *has* to print more money to account for the deflation of the recession, less they risk their debt becoming more expensive to pay off...further devaluing the dollar. Two fundamental forces acting on the increase in the value of assets. And there is a reciprocating effect, the more the fed prints the more incentive people have to leave the dollar the less businesses see real capital investors and the more deflation we see...Meaning the fed has to print more to account for it's debt starting from step 1 all over again. Hyper-inflation, as usual in the end of the fractional reserve banking cycle. The same thing happened in 1979 when silver prices were $100/oz and in 1938. And pretty much every 30-50 years since fractional reserve banking was first used (TMK) in the 13th century.

There is a notion in the investment community that gold and silver are the next big tulip crazes, and thus we should stay away. I think this is backwards, IMO the bubble is the *dollar* over the past 30 years and it's peak was in 2000 when gold hit rock bottom a symptom of the dotcom no less. You're partaking in the bubble by staying in dollars or the economy which is in recession, the *only* way out is real assets. Last one out is a rotten egg, and will be spending the rest of their lives regaining their lost value.

I have to do a paper due tomorrow on an investment portfolio game that we did for our investment class.

R^2: .504
Adjusted R^2: .493
Intercept: -0.0001  (insignificant)
Beta: 1.06  (t-stat of approx. 6.7)

R: .71

Intercept: -0.002  (insignificant)
mktrf: 1.04 (t-stat of approx. 5.3)
SMB: .29 (insignificant)
HML: .27 (insignificant)

(for the ones that have a t-stat between -1.96 and 1.96, I wrote insignificant next to the values)

I was wondering 
1)if I did it correctly?

2)why the R^2 is about the same/a little bit less for the Fama French model than the CAPM model- shouldn't the Fama French model achieve a greater r^2 value, because that would indicate the returns achieved during that period are better explained with the additional 2 factors used in the FF model?

3) how would one interpret the ""mktrf: 1.04 (t-stat of approx. 5.3)""?

0,1405805351.0,"I'm starting a masters in market finance this fall and think I might have found a topic for a research and would like your input.

After reading up on Jim Simons and his methods (and especially his returns) I was curious about a way to quantify hype on certain stocks. 

Then I found the twitter sentiment app, a beautiful tool really. I found out about Paul Hawtin, a guy who operated his own ""twitter hedge fund"" in 2012. He met with a professor who had wrote a paper on predictions on the DOW from twitter sentiment analysis and found that there was in fact something.

Hawtin actually traded and still trades today (under his new Cayman Atlantic Ltd boutique investment management firm) using twitter, and while he uses it to predict the DOW, I would like to research if there was any impact concerning individual stocks.

While this is not a new subject at all, I had never heard of it and would like to know everything about it.

Would it be a good idea to switch from the ""course version"" of the masters to the research one to pursue such subjects? 

Would it give me an edge in the financial jobs market or should I just pursue the basic masters+CFA1 (I'm still gonna do the CFA1 though). 

tl;dr: Would it be wise career-wise to spend my masters in finance researching a way of making money using twitter on individual stocks?",DOW

The ETF pays dividends, the future contract obviously doesn't, but would my return be the same? It's nice not having to reinvest dividends, and the futures contract ties up much less cash.

0,1440678798.0,"As some of us might well be aware, Hewlett-Packard (HP) has been on the legal offensive for the past years against Autonomy, which it acquired in 2011, alleging that the firm had been dishonest by jacking up its valuation at the time through inflating its earnings artificially. Autonomy, of course, declared its innocence and pinned it on HP looking for a scapegoat.

I have been reading up on this topic recently, and many publications have been attributing the entire fiasco to poor due diligence being conducted. I have a couple of questions, and I'd love to hear your views on them:

- Autonomy was audited at the time (2010) by Deloitte, which found no error with its accounting. KPMG, who was apparently in charge of financial due dil. for the deal, has maintained that it was not hired to do any formal audit work. In such a case, how would HP have conducted a more thorough DD into the company?

- Autonomy was extremely overpriced (12x LTM rev. vs 3x industry average) but HP justified it by the potential synergies and growth prospects. What are your views on this?

I just posted two Udemy.com video courses on forex trading today. The first class is called Fundamentals of Forex Trading, and it's really meant to be a short crash-course on the absolute basics of trading currencies for newbies.

The class includes a discussion of terms and definitions, a full MT4 walkthrough, and introductions to fundamental and technical analysis. THIS CLASS IS FREE!!

You can enroll in the course here: https://www.udemy.com/fundamentals-of-forex-trading/

I made a second class called How to Make Passive Income Trading Forex that teaches the sentiment trading method (automated by MetaTrader4) my partners and I use at our company PoseidonFX. The class includes 2 fully-built EA's and an in-depth discussion on how exactly to build and use an automated trading system.

This class is normally $149, but for /r/forex and /r/finance I've made the class 50% off. You can see that class by clicking the link here:

for m=1; scenarios

    for n=1; simulations

        St = st*exp(drift+vsqrdt*randvar)

        delta = exp(-r*T)*(ST/S0)*sign(ST-X);

        Shold = ...

    end

portvalue = ...

end
mean(portvalue) = ...  stdev(portvalue) = ...

My problem lies within calculating the delta of the portfolio. I am trying to use the pathwise method presented by Glasserman(2003) but am having a little trouble understanding it. Do i need to add a third nested loop inside the inner one, where at each time step another set of simulations are run, under the condition of the current price, in order to calculated the delta from a distribution of paths, or can the delta at each time step be calculated using the single St path after the original simulation completes. Another way of asking it, do I need to stop at each time step and calculate the delta from a simulated distribution, or do I calculate the deltas after the simulation has complete and go back to update the holdings. I'm trying to make this as efficient as possible so I'm wondering if a third level of nesting can be avoided. I hope my questioning is clear enough, thanks for the help.

Edit: Sorry for the terrible framing of my question.  A little more simply stated, at each time step (represented by the inner loop), I need to calculate the delta of a portfolio containing one call and one put on the same underlying stock, with the same strike price, and rebalance the portfolio to be delta neutral, by purchasing the underlying stock.  For what I have researched, a pathwise estimation of delta presented by Glasserman is one of the most efficient ways to do this.  However, I am having trouble implementing it into my delta hedging program.  

Now for better sources on the pathwise delta estimation: 
I was not actually looking at Glasserman(2003) but references to it.
I found Glasserman reference it in 1996 [Here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Zrn_sTFMLh0J:www.columbia.edu/~mnb2/broadie/Assets/bg_ms_1996.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiiOkGhQc6J77zfUbRNdZqGTzwqCvsF-j6Cy4wIbZ35cCIwimurNv8CQDvVqd8Xaz_Izc-DaBn7EuLr9IKxKxo2ZCYpplKKrSUSr8D6WexH6esIr714tCT2nKkpo6KguAUFV3pG&sig=AHIEtbSxxz0ETx-0JJnUqVEg1zxHD0Njrw) on p. 270 under pathwise derivatives.
The main paper I am trying to follow is [Here](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~staum/sas.pdf) (Sun, Apley, Staum).  They start reviewing this method specifically in Section 5: Illustrative Example and Numerical Results, and the delta equation is on p.18.  It is also recreated [Here](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/NA-07-12.pdf) by Giles as the handed coded forward method in comparison to the reverse method.",ES

Or maybe just saving and buying *x ammount* every month? I can easily say good-bye to 200 maybe 300€ a month, but knowing myself it's easier to put away a smaller ammount weekly than all at once.

Safe to click btw, you can google/wiki La Caixa, it's one of the largest banks in Spain. Doc's in spanish but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out. From what I've read there are no commissions (well there are but they take them off the top) except a 4% if you withdraw the money in less than 30 days. And then there's the state tax that takes 19% of the winnings when you withdraw.

So then, r/finance, would buying shares weekly(or monthly) in this kind of funds be a good idea? There are many other funds to choose from, this one I think is medium to high risk. From what I've read, it's a good idea to diversify and invest in various funds, but this is another story. I am at the start now, and all I am doing is I am looking at it as more of a way to save money rather than as an investment. (i.e. having money that's unavailable). Thoughts?",ES

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

0,1566048606.0,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",RE

0,1542928255.0,"I wanted to put up a discussion thread to talk to people on this theory. I'd come across it in my undergrad years and just recently re-visited the theory.

Here's a Wikipedia link. The basic idea is this: ""In the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information, and in an efficient market, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed"".

And this: ""Consider two firms which are identical except for their financial structures. The first (Firm U) is unlevered: that is, it is financed by equity only. The other (Firm L) is levered: it is financed partly by equity, and partly by debt. The Modigliani–Miller theorem states that the value of the two firms is the same.""

I work in Structured Credit where Asset-Backed Securities are issued, and my gut reaction is that if this theory were true - even including all the assumptions stated - a great deal of securitized products would not be issued.

For background, there are broadly two reasons a securitization would be issued: If the issuer wants to get attractive non-recourse leverage on a pool of their assets (ie they retain the equity) or if they want to sell a portfolio of assets completely, and believe that the sum of proceeds from the debt and equity they sell would be greater than the proceeds from selling an unlevered asset pool (ie they sell the equity to a third party). This second reason flies in the face of Modigliani Miller. But issuers sell third-party equity all the time.

~~It seems to me that what MM doesn't address is that debt investors and equity investors are disparate market segments, each with their own supply/demand dynamics. If there's a glut of capital chasing BBB opportunities they would push down the yields on BBB bonds. The same for AAA and the same for 10%+ yielding equity residuals. Given that there are all different market segments, it seems completely possible that the WACC of a company's funding structure would not be the same as the ROA. And, as far as I'm aware, all of that can happen in a market that is still efficient.~~

I understand that economic theories are usually highly abstracted, and often so general (or involving so many assumptions) that they don't directly point to the truth in economics, but only address partial truths.

So I wanted to put it up to a discussion. What do you think are the merits of the theory?

Pages 10-11 are the relevant ones here. 

A lot of what has been written regarding MM and Securitization focuses on why it makes sense to split assets out from your company and finance them off-balance sheet with a securitization. This is interesting but not what I was focused on, which was primarily, why would it make sense to securitize a pool and sell the whole stack instead of just selling the unlevered pool to a third party. In both of those cases you're getting the pool off-balance sheet by selling it. 

I think my point above about ""disparate market segments"" isn't the real answer. The NYU slide deck and the WashU Law paper above spend some time on the liquidity boost from securitization. I think this is much more compelling. It's much easier to sell out of a cusip than an asset pool, and because of this the asset pool is likely to carry an illiquidity yield premium.",RE

I know the theory on how to price american options, and I can use excel. However, I need some help on some practical issue that weren't explained in class.

-----------------------------



Let's start with the assumption that I'm pricing a put on a stock that doesn't pay any dividend.

The stock is one of the constituent of the FTSE MIB, the Italian equity index.

Let's say I have to price three ATM options:

 
one expires on the 10th of April 2014

one on the 10th of July 2014

one on the 10th of March 2015.

-----------------------------


First, regarding the data that I need:

What risk free should I use in each case? How do I find it from Bloomberg?

And, if I don't want to estimate the volatility myself, how I get them from Bloomberg, and which ones should I use in the three cases?

Now, some more technical issues regarding the three.

How many steps should I use, in each case, to get a good result?

A good value for u is exp[sigma * sqrt(timestep)]   *(and d = 1/u to have a recombining tree)*, am I correct?

-----------------------------



Now, another issue, this time I am also not 100% sure on the theory.

What if the stock pays a dividend? How can I include the discrete dividend in the tree? Do I have to  (or can I) approximate it with a dividend yield? How? Where do I get this information in Bloomberg?

-----------------------------


Thanks in advance to everyone who will take the time to help me out.

0,1332445860.0,"I am currently trying to write a two level monte carlo simulation to delta hedge a portfolio containing one call and one put. The simulation looks something like this:


for m=1; scenarios

    for n=1; simulations

        St = st*exp(drift+vsqrdt*randvar)

        delta = exp(-r*T)*(ST/S0)*sign(ST-X);

        Shold = ...

    end

portvalue = ...

end
mean(portvalue) = ...  stdev(portvalue) = ...

My problem lies within calculating the delta of the portfolio. I am trying to use the pathwise method presented by Glasserman(2003) but am having a little trouble understanding it. Do i need to add a third nested loop inside the inner one, where at each time step another set of simulations are run, under the condition of the current price, in order to calculated the delta from a distribution of paths, or can the delta at each time step be calculated using the single St path after the original simulation completes. Another way of asking it, do I need to stop at each time step and calculate the delta from a simulated distribution, or do I calculate the deltas after the simulation has complete and go back to update the holdings. I'm trying to make this as efficient as possible so I'm wondering if a third level of nesting can be avoided. I hope my questioning is clear enough, thanks for the help.

Edit: Sorry for the terrible framing of my question.  A little more simply stated, at each time step (represented by the inner loop), I need to calculate the delta of a portfolio containing one call and one put on the same underlying stock, with the same strike price, and rebalance the portfolio to be delta neutral, by purchasing the underlying stock.  For what I have researched, a pathwise estimation of delta presented by Glasserman is one of the most efficient ways to do this.  However, I am having trouble implementing it into my delta hedging program.  

Now for better sources on the pathwise delta estimation: 
I was not actually looking at Glasserman(2003) but references to it.
I found Glasserman reference it in 1996 [Here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Zrn_sTFMLh0J:www.columbia.edu/~mnb2/broadie/Assets/bg_ms_1996.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiiOkGhQc6J77zfUbRNdZqGTzwqCvsF-j6Cy4wIbZ35cCIwimurNv8CQDvVqd8Xaz_Izc-DaBn7EuLr9IKxKxo2ZCYpplKKrSUSr8D6WexH6esIr714tCT2nKkpo6KguAUFV3pG&sig=AHIEtbSxxz0ETx-0JJnUqVEg1zxHD0Njrw) on p. 270 under pathwise derivatives.
The main paper I am trying to follow is [Here](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~staum/sas.pdf) (Sun, Apley, Staum).  They start reviewing this method specifically in Section 5: Illustrative Example and Numerical Results, and the delta equation is on p.18.

0,1401386661.0,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the right place to put it, but is a Q that has been bugging me for the last couple of days. Final year uni student in the field, and this question has cropped up a few times in my reading, but the calc doesn't seem right?

From what I recall: Portfolio Variance = Systematic + Unsystematic

Unsystematic (idiosyncratic) is effectively equal to tracking error/residual variance from regression.

Systematic I believe is Beta^2 * Market Variance. 

Given the two, the answers dont seem to be adding up at all!

Brief example: Assume 10% Exp Return, whereby B is 0.96, portfolio sd = 11 and tracking error = 3. Whatever I do I cant seem to get it all to add up!

Apologies if this is the wrong sub-reddit, its not really a homework q per-se, but more so one that has confused me more on the financial points of defining risk when reading up on the subject!

Right now i am doing a B.A.(double major in Political Science and English Language and minor in Sociology) I am thinking of doing an MBA after this, probably in finance management. What i want to know is that do companies also take a look at your undergrad subjects while hiring? Will people who have science/commerce undergrad degrees and then done an MBA given preference and higher salaries than an arts graduate?

Do you think 4-5 year experience in banking(normal banking, not investment banking) would be enough so as to neutralize the fact of me having a liberal art degree? I am also thinking of doing CFA while working in banking.

Do you think if, before going for MBA, I get lots of work exp, as well as additional qualifications like CFA(I know you need 4 years investment experience, however i could pass the three exams without receiving the charter), maybe even a correspondence degree in commerce, all these things will offset my liberal arts degree?

I'd appreciate if i get some insight into this as i am really worried about my future.

Oil investors may regret urging companies to cough up cash now instead of investing in growth for later as the dearth of exploration is setting the stage for an unprecedented crude price spike, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Companies have been compelled to focus on boosting returns and shareholder distributions at the expense of capital expenditures aimed at finding new supplies, analysts including Neil Beveridge wrote in a note Friday. That’s causing reserves at major producers to fall and the industry’s reinvestment ratio to plunge to the lowest in a generation, paving the way for oil prices to surpass records reached last decade, according to Bernstein.

“Investors who had egged on management teams to reign in capex and return cash will lament the underinvestment in the industry,” the analysts wrote. “Any shortfall in supply will result in a super-spike in prices, potentially much larger than the $150 a barrel spike witnessed in 2008.”

The world’s oil majors including [Royal Dutch Shell Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RDSA:NA) and [BP Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BP%2F:LN) navigated the price crash of 2014 by cutting costs, selling assets and taking on debt to help satisfy investors with hefty dividends. The biggest, [Exxon Mobil Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XOM:US), was [punished by shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P5A1YH6VDKHT) earlier this year after compounding disappointing results with a massive spending plan and a lack of buybacks.

The oversupply of crude globally in recent years has masked “chronic underinvestment,” Bernstein said in the report. Oil has rebounded to the highest in more than three years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies started curbing output at the beginning of last year to trim a global glut. The producers aim now to [pump more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-26/opec-supply-buffer-shrinks-as-it-answers-calls-to-pump-more-oil) to help cool the market, but disruptions from Libya to Venezuela are keeping prices elevated.

[See also: Repsol Shows Faith in Oil’s Rally With Dividend, Spending Boost](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/repsol-shows-faith-in-oil-s-rally-with-dividend-spending-boost)

Proven reserves of the world’s top oil companies have fallen by more than 30 percent on average since 2000, with only Exxon and BP showing an improvement, helped by acquisitions, Bernstein said. Meanwhile, more than 1 billion people will urbanize in Asia over the next two decades and this will drive demand for cars, as well as air travel, road freight and plastics that also require oil, according to Bernstein.

“If oil demand continues to grow to 2030 and beyond, the strategy of returning cash to shareholders and underinvesting in reserves will only turn out to sow the seeds of the next super-cycle,” the analysts wrote. “Companies which have barrels in the ground to produce, or the services to extract them, will be the ones to own and those who do not will be left behind.”

Brent oil rallied to an all-time high above $147 a barrel in 2008 as booming demand growth and a lack of readily available resources fueled a synchronized surge across commodities that was dubbed the super-cycle. The global benchmark was at $76.78 a barrel as of 11:57 a.m. in London on Friday, up about 60 percent in the past year.",XOM

Facebook IPO: The Facts and Figures Behind One Of The Largest Offerings Ever : business
-----
http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ol64e/facebook_ipo_the_facts_and_figures_behind_one_of/　

What I have uncovered is that there a lot of favoritism that goes on when investment bankers allocate stocks to investors during the pre-IPO process. 
**How an pre-IPO offering is setup**
The simplified flow of a pre-IPO offering is that A) a company considering an IPO chooses an Investment Banker (bookmaker). B) This bookmaker has his own circle of investor friends and likely also some kind of retail outlet and/or contacts with other circles of rich investors. This is called the syndicate. C) The bookmaker or book runner creates a prospectus explaining all the potential pitfalls of this IPO release and then goes around to his syndicate of investors and takes orders. D) Investors bid on what they think the offering is worth and how much stock they want to purchase. This is called “price discovery”. E) Once all the orders are taken the bookmakers then allocate stocks based on how much was offered. ***Here is where the unfairness exists*** F) The bookmaker allocates based upon which investor he has a better relationship with. The retail sales (the little guy that buys through a broker or something) gets little to nothing, and the big investors get massive allocations. The thing is, these deals are set up to always be about 15% *even before the IPO release*. Then upon release the price is setup to make at least another 15% by being intentionally under priced (so they don’t loose any money [no risk])

If I am wrong about any part of this please let me know but the point is that the allocation process is flawed and not fair. It screws the little guy and even the small/mid-sized investor.

0,1472163080.0,"I'm a software developer working in finance, and my employer is willing to cover the costs of me studying towards a CFA (i.e. provide classes and pay for exam fees). I'm not sure how valuable it would be for me though, as I'm a developer not a trader. I'm good at maths, I'm a fast learner, I'm interested in finance, and long term I'd like to work on high-frequency-trading, albeit on the performance/engineering side rather than algorithmic.

How worthwhile would a CFA be to someone in my position? It could be a valuable qualification to have, but since my skills and interests are more engineering focused than finance, I'm not sure if it'd actually be worthwhile for someone in my position.

I'm currently working on my bachelor dissertation on the vix index and its derivatives and in my research I found that rolling short term vix futures could be used as a hedge tool for a portfolio strongly correlated with the sp500. I'd like to test this hypothesis over the last ten years (and I can easily find all the necessary data), but I don't really know how to compute it efficiently using excel:I know how a future work of course, but I don't have the time to calculate ""manually"" every single return or loss each month for 10 years.

""Here is what to notice. Revenue has gone up very nicely - from $664 million to $2.2 billion and is still increasing. And costs have gone up commensurately. Losses seem stubbornly stuck at half a billion per annum. That is real money - just burnt - and burnt by a business that is already established.

In other words costs have gone up by $1.5 billion give or take something. That is billion with a b.

Now if costs were rising that fast and the service were noticeably improving and engagement growing then you could be tolerant. Making money is far less important in a growing tech company than increasing your relevance and the moat that surrounds your business. (Amazon is the leading example of a company which increases the moat every day.) The short-hand for that thinking is that revenue follows relevance.""

and: 

""But - as a pretty dedicated tweeter (with almost 20 thousand followers) - I have noticed almost no changes in twitter that improve my user experience. It is almost impossible to find out what they spend that $1.5 billion extra per annum on. I gather there are some improvements in the monetisation side but this is just a website - and it does roughly what it did in 2012 - and but spends well over a billion dollars more to do the same thing. [From my perspective the marginal improvement is that I am seeing fewer failed-to-load pages... but that is it.]

Twitter has become a parody of bad Silicon Valley management - the sort of management that existed in the dot-com boom where quite literally burning shareholder funds was considered a mark of innovation. 

The main difference between this and (say) Pets.Com is that underneath is a business that should be salvageable - and should make pot-loads of money. After all if they raised costs by $1.5 billion per annum without achieving jack-shit then costs should be able to be controlled""

Shrink and swim strategy leaves the City without a global investment bank, writes Philip Augar 

he final curtain is about to come down on one of the City’s of London’s longest running shows. Ever since Big Bang in 1986, when deregulation opened up access to securities markets, the attempts of British banks to compete with the leading Wall Street houses have created a compelling spectacle full of big bets, ruined reputations, and fortunes won and lost. But comments last week from John Mc­Farlane, Barclays’ chairman, suggest that the play is finally moving to a smaller theatre.

“When you look at the dominant investment banks, they are North American” said Mr McFarlane. “They have the scale that we no longer have to be global so we are going to have to focus.” It was a devastating comment from the head of the one British institution in the investment banking big league. Is he right and if so what does that mean for Barclays and the City?

What to do about investment banking is a question that has troubled Barclays ever since 1983, the year Timothy Bevan, a great-grandson of the first chairman, signed off on a proposal to buy and build an investment bank. It proved to be harder than it looked for Barclays and the other British groups trying to muscle in on Wall Street. The Americans had capital, experienced management and a hugely profitable home market. They powered into London, grabbed the biggest deals, hired many of the best bankers and squeezed margins. Globally aspiring UK investment banks were forced to give up.Barclays was the last one standing until it sold its equities and corporate finance business in 1998.

But Barclays and investment banking were not quite done. Under the American Bob Diamond, it cleverly worked its way back into the business, culminating in the acquisition of Lehman’s US business in 2008. It secured and indeed retains a seat at Wall Street’s top table.

Yet just as Barclays sat down, others got up to leave. Stringent regulations after the crisis forced banks to conserve capital and cut unprofitable businesses. Clients who had once preferred to buy products from full-service institutions came to accept that specialists have a role to play. The fashionable investment-banking model has become the slimmed down, return on assets-focused version exemplified by the likes of UBS rather than that of the monsters that once gobbled up market share and capital. Only a handful of global players remain.

The “shrink-and-swim” strategy implied by Barclays last week is thus perfectly credible. It starts from a position of strength; pruning is easier than growing; and investment banking-light is a proposition shareholders, clients and staff find credible today.

Yet Barclays’ decision to refocus has consequences for the City. It would leave the UK without a global competitor — just as it was between 1998, when the company last withdrew from full-service investment banking, and 2008 when it went back in.

Last time it seemed superficially not to matter. London flourished as a global financial services capital. Employees, clients and regulators grew used to the idea that head office was in New York; and jubilant bankers derided the idea of national identity in the fast and fluid world of global finance.

The banking crisis gave cause for second thoughts about this Panglossian idea. By adopting US-style investment banking, the City had thrown away its cherished traditions of prudence and patience, and left the UK unhealthily exposed to a business it did not understand. What happened in the next decade was that the authorities stood back and lost control.

The presence of Barclays Capital in the middle of the global stage offered a brief period of knowledge and influence. Its absence will leave the UK more vulnerable.

I'm currently working at a firm that specializes in the purchase of distressed real estate and mortgages.  Our clients are typically hedge funds, high net worth individuals, and private wealth management groups, and we help them by locating and analyzing properties as well as facilitating negotiations with banks.  I've been with this firm for about two years now, and it's small enough that I've had a chance to take on a lot of responsibility, much of which has been client-facing.

0,1383826395.0,"Both were rewarded this years econ nobel price for contradictory research. Shiller, a pioneer of behavior finance, says markets can exhibit irrationality and bubbles can be predicted. Fama, the originator of the efficient market hypothesis, believes markets are rational and bubbles do not exist, which preludes any ability to predict them. 

IMHO, shiller is like a showman with moviestar looks. Markets are nearly impossible to predict because in retrospect many bubbles like Facebook, for example, now seem rational. It is demonstrably impossible to exploit 'bubbles' to achieve excess returns, even during the late 90's.  For a couple reasons: liquidity, timing, and margin calls. It's hard to find shares to short, if you time it wrong you will get a margin call and be forced quickly out of the position at a large loss even if you original thesis is correct. For example, in 2007 Microsoft purchased a small stake in Facebook , valuing the social networking site at $15 billion. Everyone in the media and blogs (except me and some others) as convinced it was bubble. Fast forward to 2013 and Facebook is worth 110 billion. Anyone went on the opposite side of that trade (assuming facebook was a public company) would have lost 500-700% of their money.

 The shiller PE ratio index is also of dubious value due to insufficient datapoints, overshoots, etc. You can't use the index to extrapolate any statically significant predictions. A PE of 40 is overvalued, but we only have one instance in history when the S&P PE ratio was that high so it's hard to make an inference from one example.

The Shiller housing index is also useless because real estate is driven by local dynamics. Bay Area real estate was largely insulated from the 2008 crisis and was the quickest to rebound to new highs. ",FAST
0,1342143493.0,"Im not sure if this is the right sub-reddit, but I am hoping that you guys might be able to help. I will preface this with that I know very little of how stocks or the stock market work.

When I was a kid, upon my grandfather's passing, my grandmother used some of his money to buy 24 shares each of stock in the Walt Disney Company for me and my two younger sisters.

At the time of purchase the stock was managed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and was placed both in our names as well as our father's because we were all minors.

Somewhere in my teens, my father had some extra money and wanted to makes some small investments.  He decided to use Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who at the time, refused to allow two accounts to exist at the same addess.  Consequently, he removed our stocks from their management and started a new account in his name.  In the interest of transparency, he had all of the stock certificates mailed to our house, showed them to us, and put them in a fireproof safe.

Fast-forward about 15 years to 2012... Disney at some point, which as of yet I am unaware of the official date, has sold off the value of our stock and turned it over to the State of New York.  They claim that this was due to inactivity (although, who's to say what constitutes activity?).  The most I can think of is that none of us had cashed any dividend checks (most were in the amounts of $2-3 at most, and were not issued consistently on an annual basis), and at least since it was removed from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's control, we had not voted on any stock splits (I don't recall being notified of any in ~10 years either).

So, with all of the history, the questions I have left open are:

1. The value in cash that was turned over to the state, according to the state comptroller, is considerably less than the value of the stock today.  Can Disney legally cash out our shares like this?

2.  I have been told that because the official original certificates are in our possession (and they are), we still own that stock, and there is nothing Disney can do about it.  I find that slightly hard to believe, but is there any validity to it?

I am totally lost, and I am waiting on some paperwork from the state with more details, but any help or advice would be hugely appreciated.",FAST

    1     HPQ       40.81    40.14    -0.67           -1.64
    2     FDX       89.79    87.89    -1.90           -2.12
    3     PEP       63.49    63.24    -0.25           -0.39

So on day 1, I bought and sold HPQ for a return of -$0.67 or -1.64%. I now want to calculate, in %, how my trades performed against the market:

    day    market return (%)    my return (%)    excess return (%)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1      -2.03                -1.64             0.39  (-1.64 - -2.03)
    2       1.09                -2.12             3.21
    3       0.16                -0.39            -0.55
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    total  -0.78                -4.15            -3.37  (-4.15 - -0.78)

For instance, on day 1 the market (S&P100 index) went down 1.64% but the stock I bought only went down 1.64%. In other words, my trade ""outperformed"" the market by 0.39%. When totalling, the market lost 0.78% during the three days, but my trades lost -4.15%. The way I interpret this, my trades underperformed 3.37% against the market.

Alternatively, if I take the first (574.19) and last (572.93) price of the market indexfund, the market only declined ((572.93 - 574.19) / 574.19) * 100 = -0.22%. Based on this number, my trades underperformed the market by -3.37 - -0.22 = -3.15%

**Question 1** How do the 2 market performances that I calculated (-0.78% and -0.22%) relate to each other?

**Question 2** How do I correctly culculate the relative performance of my trades against the market? Is is -3.37% or -3.15%? And if it's neither, how do I calculate with how many % my trading outperformed (or underperformed) the market?",FDX

So there must have been some banks and FI's that made massive profit over the default of CDO's and other MBS in 2007-08 correct?

For example, equities are always regarded as ""sexier"", however I've heard that the market for FI is bigger, hence that would mean more jobs available. Also, i'm not sure which one would be a better fit for me. I am good mathematically, but I wouldn't say that I'm fantastic at math or I love math alot. I would prefer to strike a balance between quantitative and qualitative aspects.

Also, would a person studying equities be unsuitable for a role in FI and vice versa? That being said, which of the would you suggest me to pursue? I am also asking this because I would most probably like to get an internship in the near future related to one of equity or FI, but I am still undecided on my ideal career path and I would like to learn something that offers me more flexibility between the different areas of finance.

I have a question that is probably really simple but I can't seem to find the answer anywhere. 

If I go to Bloomberg, I can find the rates of US FI securities (http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us) for multiple expirations. 

My question is, are these the rates (and equivalently, prices) that are being traded in market? I know the market prices the probability of rate rises into the prices of these sorts of products, which would mean that the prices should fluctuate, but I can't tell if the prices on Bloomberg, or any sight for that matter, give the market rate, or the rate originally printed on the bond.

I feel like the classic books on value investing i.e. The Intelligent Investor, Security Analysis, Margin of Safety, etc. are great but because of changes in technology and the speed with which information can be exchanged today, the way that value investing is done is likely different than the way it was when these texts were written. My question is how do we go about finding companies that are under or conversely overvalued and how do we know how much of a margin of safety we have? Are there any more modern texts that detail this process? Do valuation models like DCF and residual income come into play here? How does the statement of cashflows affect one's view of a company with regard to valuation? 

tl;dr How does one do research and apply Ben Graham's value investing strategy in the vastly more complex modern securities market? Are there any books or article to be read on this?

Ben Toucan, owner of the Aspen Restaurant, wants to determine the present value of his investment. The Aspen Restaurant is currently in the development stage but Toucan hopes to “begin” operations early next year. After-tax cash flows during the next five years are expected to be as follows: 

Year 1	0

Year 2	0

Year 3	0

Year 4	$2.5 millions

Year 5	$3 millions

Cash inflows are expected to be $3.18 million in year 6 and are expected to to grow at a 6% annual rate thereafter. Assuming that venture investors often use different discount rates when valuing ventures at various stages of their life cycles. For example, target discount rates by life cycle stage are: development stage 50%, start-up stage 40%, survival stage 35% and early rapid-growth stage 30%. As ventures move from their late rapid-growth stages and into their maturity stages, a 20% discount rate is often used.

a-	Determine the Aspen Restaurant’s terminal or horizon value at the end of five years, assuming the venture will be entering its maturity stage. (2 marks)

b-	What is the present value of the Aspen Restaurant, assuming that it is a development-stage venture? (2 marks)


I am interested more in the present value and used the Equation (Because CF in years 1-3 is 0 I won't include them) : 


Year 4: 2500000/1.5^4 = $493,827

Year 5: (3,000,000 + (3,180,000/**(.5**-.06)) / 1.5^5 = $1,346,792

These two added gives me a present value of $1,840,619

My worry is that the bolded value in year 5 is supposed to be .2 due maturity stage Discount rate.

0,1387177297.0,"I am an undergrad in Finance, and I just started reading The Big Short by Michael Lewis. In the second chapter, he says:

>He came to a passage explaining why banks felt they needed credit default swaps at all. It wasn't immediately obivous--after all, the best way to avoid the risk of General Electirc's default on it debt was not to lend to General Electric in the first place. In the beginning, credit default swaps had been a tool for hedging. Some banks had loaned more than they wanted to General Electic because GE has asked for it, and they feared alienating a long-standing client; however another bank changed its mind about the wisdom of lending to GE at all. Very quickly, however, the new derivatives became tools for speculation: A lot of people wanted to make bets on the likelihood of GE's defaulting."" (pg. 30)
>

This brought up a question I had. Who in their right minds would buy a CDS against GE? Which brought upon a bigger question: Who in their right minds would buy a CDS against many of these large corporations? Is it purely speculative? Are there enough individual investors willing to bet against hundred-year-old companies that they buy wiliingly a CDS against large, out-standing companies such as GE? I find it hard to believe a large bank would buy CDSs against such companies. So when a bank decides to hedge against their risk against a company such as GE, Exxon, or Apple, is there a large bank on the other side buying up these CDSs? 

Also, I'm not entirely sure: are CDSs exchange traded, or OTC traded? If they were exchange traded, I can see how individual investors could be purswayed to invest in CDSs against these companies, but if they were OTC traded, how would they convince their contacts who -- I assume -- are much more informed than your average trader?

Much of my knowledge of finance is textbook quality, so I'm not sure of the ""here's the real world"" type answers, so don't assume anything might be too obvious. According to the quote above, it is speculators who are buying these, which I guess leads me to a tangent question: How much speculative buying goes on at large banks? I had assumed most of their buying was much more grounded in quantitative reasoning, and not speculation. Are these other large banks who are buying this on speculation? Could there possibly be other departments within the same bank who are willing to speculate on these CDSs and end up washing out the net hedge against the CDSs?

Sorry if I packed too many questions in one post, but this one little passage brought up a lot of questions for me that, honestly, I hadn't considered when reading the textbook definition of ""credit default swap."" ",GE

0,1359409146.0,"Hey guys, new to this sub so sorry if this has been answered or isn't covered here. This will be long, so bear with me. I have a somewhat different approach it seems to my personal finances that I don't see an issue with but others might. One of my biggest concerns is the seemingly insurmountable debt everyone seems to be in. Some crazy figure like $47,000 debt for the average household? that seems insane to me. I know this covers things like mortgage, car payments, credit cards etc. but still, why get in that situation? I decided a while ago I don't want any debt, but I don't know if that idea is even possible today. Basic rundown of my current state is as follows; Right now I am in the military and am about to get out. I have a meager salary (let's say about $30,000 a year in money straight to me) and about $2500 of student loan debt that I make minimal payments on. I do intend to just write them a check in the coming months to just wipe that out entirely. The military covers my housing which would be an extra $2000 a month on to my salary that I don't count because it won't always be there. I intend to get out this year. I own both of my cars outright which are a 2001 ford explorer, and a 92' camry. I paid $2000 for the explorer and $600 for the camry. its not luxury by any stretch but they work well. I actually also own a jeep cherokee I paid $3000 for, but it doesn't work at the moment and I'll basically be giving it away because it'll cost too much time and money to get everything straightened out how it needs to be before I leave here. 

my goal when I get out is to have enough saved up to hold me over for a while. I do have a trip planned right after, but once that is done I am trying to position myself to have about $15,000 saved up to hold me over until I either go to school (gi bill will pay my rent, and I can work part time) or get a job somewhere. My trip will last 6 months and cost about 10,000 (not dipping in to the 15K savings) for me and my wife. we intend to spend a lot of that time soul-searching and working out a few ideas we've had in the last 2 years to be self-sufficient that haven't been possible while I'm stationed in Hawaii. These ideas range from internet based companies to small eateries to inventions I've come up with (one of which is marketable to the military), retail products or licensing, even 3 cellphone apps I'm designing right now (have a programmer friend who is a 30% partner and gives me creative control). I know they're not all possible or smart, but we're both young and want to give it a shot on our own while we can afford to make mistakes. 

Ok so my real question comes down to whether or not its possible to do the things I'm talking about or even live a normal life without getting in to debt. We have a credit card for small incidentals that only has a $300 limit so we can't overspend on it. Other than that, I don't want any loans or creditors. I'm ok buying $1000 cars that work, I'm ok renting a house instead of buying while I build up the savings to actually buy. Or even building one myself. Some of my ideas are things like buying a couple acres of land somewhere cheap and slowly building my own house on my land. There's even plans online for 1 man to fell his own trees and build a log cabin in a matter of a couple months. I don't think I'll go that extreme but my point is there are other ways to go. Even buying foreclosures for $15,000-$30,000 wouldn't be that hard after a couple years of saving. 

I also feel like not going to the bank for a loan when I want something makes me be more strategic with the money I have now, and makes me work harder to have an idea succeed. If I can make the money for a house outright in 5 years and never need a loan I'd be thrilled. the ultimate end-game would be to hopefully have a couple of our ideas take off, and be able to afford buying a nice car, a nice house, and live a stable life and build a nest-egg for our future children's college funds without worrying about owing the bank for any of it.

So is this completely insane, or can it be done. do you have any tips to achieving something like this? (I have some money in stocks, military 401k, made some money on the silver boom, dabble in forex with small ~$100 investments). Or am I way off base and is getting a loan BETTER as some have suggested? I can't see how owing someone money rather than owning something outright would be a good thing, but maybe I'm missing something.

Any input would be greatly appreciated. I will respond to all comments (that aren't outright insulting) and can offer more clarity on certain things if needed. Thanks for your time!",GIS

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

My sources of information so far are USDA reports, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, are these good places to start? 

What drives prices? I know fertilizer sales depend on commodity prices as higher prices attract farmers to produce more commodities; increasing the demand for fertilizers. 

Is there likely to be any shocks to the industry - e.g. backlashes over GM seeds etc. 

Could anyone experienced in this area please pass on some good advice they've learned from working in this area, I'd really appreciate it!

0,1382530171.0,"First of all, I would like to say that I support TSLA's ideas fully, I believe that we should start using electric cars. But these facts don't change the fact that I wouldn't buy TSLA for this simple reason: its overvalued. 

Currently TSLA has a market capitalization of $20B which isn't a huge number when you compare it to big players in the market such as GM, Honda or Ford which have $50B, $72B, $70B in respect but it is still a very huge number for a company who didn't made profit yet. And this number is an especially big number for a company that made $385M revenue in 2012 since this company also lost $396M.

I know making loses is part of the R&D process and tsla might start the reap the fruits of the money spent on R&D with its new products. Lets be over optimistic and say that they will be making 100x more money than they used to by next year this time and will generate a revenue of $40B. $110B shy from GM's revenue in year 2012. And also in order to generate this revenue they would have to sell 363,000 cars(based on model s85p price of 110). Which is highly unlikely considering tesla was planning to create 800 model s's by late 2014. 

This is why I wouldn't buy tsla at its current price point. I think they have a great idea, a great business plan and they might have great products, but they're too expensive to be a sound investment. 

**Fun fact:** Ellon Musk has 5 million something stock options in his company. Although I don't know their price points I would say they are pretty low considering they were isssued in 2012

0,1426819799.0,"Hey /r/finance. If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

EDIT: A lot of the comments below have been added into the main post, thanks to everyone for contributing! If I missed your comment, shoot me a PM and I'll check it out.

0,1437629508.0,"I recently graduated from one of the top Business Schools in France and have been trying to break into a Real Estate-focused role (REIB, Services, Research, Development, etc).

Given my lack of internships in that area I'm open to taking a Big4/TAS/M&A path, but with over 100 applications across a variety of regions (Canada, UK, Continental Europe) and positions I can't even get an interview. I'm getting rejected from basic jobs that any Bachelor can get and it's got me wondering what's wrong with my profile. Most of my applications are for the UK as my French is not good enough.

The file is anonymized in certain areas, many thanks in advance should anyone take a look.

0,1332445860.0,"I am currently trying to write a two level monte carlo simulation to delta hedge a portfolio containing one call and one put. The simulation looks something like this:


for m=1; scenarios

    for n=1; simulations

        St = st*exp(drift+vsqrdt*randvar)

        delta = exp(-r*T)*(ST/S0)*sign(ST-X);

        Shold = ...

    end

portvalue = ...

end
mean(portvalue) = ...  stdev(portvalue) = ...

My problem lies within calculating the delta of the portfolio. I am trying to use the pathwise method presented by Glasserman(2003) but am having a little trouble understanding it. Do i need to add a third nested loop inside the inner one, where at each time step another set of simulations are run, under the condition of the current price, in order to calculated the delta from a distribution of paths, or can the delta at each time step be calculated using the single St path after the original simulation completes. Another way of asking it, do I need to stop at each time step and calculate the delta from a simulated distribution, or do I calculate the deltas after the simulation has complete and go back to update the holdings. I'm trying to make this as efficient as possible so I'm wondering if a third level of nesting can be avoided. I hope my questioning is clear enough, thanks for the help.

Edit: Sorry for the terrible framing of my question.  A little more simply stated, at each time step (represented by the inner loop), I need to calculate the delta of a portfolio containing one call and one put on the same underlying stock, with the same strike price, and rebalance the portfolio to be delta neutral, by purchasing the underlying stock.  For what I have researched, a pathwise estimation of delta presented by Glasserman is one of the most efficient ways to do this.  However, I am having trouble implementing it into my delta hedging program.  

Now for better sources on the pathwise delta estimation: 
I was not actually looking at Glasserman(2003) but references to it.
I found Glasserman reference it in 1996 [Here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Zrn_sTFMLh0J:www.columbia.edu/~mnb2/broadie/Assets/bg_ms_1996.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiiOkGhQc6J77zfUbRNdZqGTzwqCvsF-j6Cy4wIbZ35cCIwimurNv8CQDvVqd8Xaz_Izc-DaBn7EuLr9IKxKxo2ZCYpplKKrSUSr8D6WexH6esIr714tCT2nKkpo6KguAUFV3pG&sig=AHIEtbSxxz0ETx-0JJnUqVEg1zxHD0Njrw) on p. 270 under pathwise derivatives.
The main paper I am trying to follow is [Here](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~staum/sas.pdf) (Sun, Apley, Staum).  They start reviewing this method specifically in Section 5: Illustrative Example and Numerical Results, and the delta equation is on p.18.  It is also recreated [Here](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/NA-07-12.pdf) by Giles as the handed coded forward method in comparison to the reverse method.",GL

0,1318167648.0,"I am currently talking with GS and may get an interview at some point, and I was wondering what kind of shenanigans they actually pull on you while you are being interviewed.  I have heard all kinds of stories, but I don't know if there is any truth behind them.  

I have heard that an example of something they may ask you is: how many ping pong balls it takes to fill a 747 jet (the answer is approximately 7,257,600 from what I was able to find).  If something like that is true, do they want a fast, exact number you pulled out of your ass showing that you are decisive and quick on your feet, or do they want to see you think about it and watch you calculate something?

Thanks for any responses and if you have any questions about me, Ill be sure to fill you in.",GS

My friend recommended Trading Volatility by Colin Bennett but I was wondering if you guys had any other recommendations. Thanks!",GS

Wouldn't it be wise to liquidate as much as possible before it gets any worse at the moment? And potentially keep out until the market cools down? 

I know midstream companies aren't getting hit as hard as producers, and perhaps looking into natural gas plays for cheap stocks might a good idea, but I'd like to see what the the banks, or even macro funds, are doing in this market.

0,1424901861.0,"Okay so here is the situation. We bought 30 shares of Halliburton in 2012 at a price of 32.19 per share for a cost basis of $965.70. We then bought 30 more shares in July of 2014 at a share price of 73.69 for a an additional cost of $2210.07. When you add $2210 to the initial $965.70 we have a new cost basis of $3176.40. The share price of HAL has since fallen to 40.19 as of Dec, 31st 2014. The market value of our 60 shares would then be $2,411.40. So in my eyes our return is 2,411.40-3176.40=-765 or a -24% return (-765/3176.40). 

So I have argued that our cumulative return is -24%. My professor has argued (using HPR formula and Compound Annual Growth) that our cumulative return is actually a positive 22%. He can't be right, can he? He is very stubborn on this and we got in a pretty heated debate about it. I have been pretty stubborn about this as well.

Lets say I am wrong. Then cumulative return is extremely flawed. If I were an investor and you talked up HAL by telling me we had a 22% cumulative return on it, I would think you were lying to my face and I would be offended. That isn't realistic. It seems to me that it is a false measurement which makes me wonder why we would even calculate this number. 

 I will concede that I might be looking at this from the wrong angle. That is why I am asking you for help in understanding this before I ruin my relationship with my professor.

Valuation is a topic in finance that is vulnerable to a higher level of bias in its work. In this lecture, Aswath Damodaran speaks about how the bias impacts the field today and offers useful insight as to how to manage it.

Due to my field of work/study, I've encountered many of the same issues that Aswath discusses, and his lecture sure helped me consider a more pragmatic approach to the proccess.

Masayoshi Son is finally disclosing the damage from SoftBank Group Corp.’s bets on WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.
The Japanese investment powerhouse on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years -- about $6.5 billion --after writing down the value of a string of marquee investments. It swallowed a charge of 497.7 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for WeWork, whose spectacular implosion turned the once high-flying shared-office startup into a Silicon Valley punchline.


The losses call into question the billionaire founder Son’s deal-making approach just as he’s trying to raise an even larger successor to his $100 billion Vision Fund. The investment vehicle had been a driver of profit growth at SoftBank, contributing over $14 billion in mostly paper gains over the past two years. The shrinking valuation of Uber and WeWork, once among the brightest stars in the SoftBank constellation, also raises the prospects of more writedowns in the Vision Fund’s portfolio with its high exposure to businesses that prioritize growth over profitability.
“Son’s handling of WeWork raises some fundamental questions about his investment strategy that need to be addressed,” Jefferies Group senior analyst Atul Goyal said ahead of the earnings release. “There will be more failed investments in the future, how does he plan to handle them?”


The operating loss was 704.4 billion yen in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement. That easily surpassed the 230.8 billion yen average of analysts’ projections, and compared with a 705.7 billion yen profit a year earlier. Its signature Vision Fund -- the world’s single largest pool of startup investments -- reported a 970.3 billion yen loss in the quarter.


SoftBank reported 537.9 billion yen of unrealized losses in a plethora of investments from Uber to WeWork. Analysts had predicted a charge to be in excess of $5 billion and as much as $7 billion. The co-working startup was valued at $7.8 billion at the end of September -- a precipitous fall from about $47 billion in January.


Late last month, WeWork secured a $9.5 billion rescue package from SoftBank, a deal that handed 80% of the company to the Japanese conglomerate. That’s on top of the more than $10 billion SoftBank and its Vision Fund have already invested into the co-working giant. SoftBank has said it didn’t get a majority of voting rights, meaning its troubled investee will be treated as an associate, not a subsidiary -- potentially keeping its balance sheet free of some $22 billion of debt and $47 billion in looming lease-payment obligations.


The deal includes $5 billion in new financing and an acceleration of a $1.5 billion existing commitment. SoftBank will also offer to buy as much as $3 billion from existing shareholders. WeWork’s founder Adam Neumann left the company’s board as part of the package, replaced by SoftBank executive and newly appointed Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure.",HAS

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",HAS

The average investor believes the 2000 and 2008 and 2011 declines are/were temporary, and they are. But how temporary? It's been 12 years and we still are in decline if the dow is indexed in real US dollars. The dow only a few weeks ago was the same level it was in 2000, 2008, 2006, 2001, and 2010. A level which is measured in inflating dollars. Accounting for inflation we are at where we were in the early 90s and late 80s.

In recessions, as usual, investors realize they need to pull out into cash. More and more investors are realizing this is a lost decade or even a lost year or 4 years. They will want to step away for a few years. Then will quickly realize, or already knew, holding cash is just as bad of an investment. They will then turn to hedges against inflation, real assets, further devaluing the dollar. They will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value. Meanwhile, the fed *has* to print more money to account for the deflation of the recession, less they risk their debt becoming more expensive to pay off...further devaluing the dollar. Two fundamental forces acting on the increase in the value of assets. And there is a reciprocating effect, the more the fed prints the more incentive people have to leave the dollar the less businesses see real capital investors and the more deflation we see...Meaning the fed has to print more to account for it's debt starting from step 1 all over again. Hyper-inflation, as usual in the end of the fractional reserve banking cycle. The same thing happened in 1979 when silver prices were $100/oz and in 1938. And pretty much every 30-50 years since fractional reserve banking was first used (TMK) in the 13th century.

There is a notion in the investment community that gold and silver are the next big tulip crazes, and thus we should stay away. I think this is backwards, IMO the bubble is the *dollar* over the past 30 years and it's peak was in 2000 when gold hit rock bottom a symptom of the dotcom no less. You're partaking in the bubble by staying in dollars or the economy which is in recession, the *only* way out is real assets. Last one out is a rotten egg, and will be spending the rest of their lives regaining their lost value.

0,1414961728.0,"Firstly, please don't down vote if you don't like it,  I am trying to get some feedback! 

That being said this is how I see it-

The first prerequisite to this is understanding that money is a zero sum game. 
To explain that,  let's say I pick a random star in the sky and ask you how much you would pay for it (right now, today). You would own the star but there's not really much you can do with it as of this point in technology, so you might pay $10, $100, $1000 or maybe $1m, but probably not much than that because there's nothing we can do with stars at this point (and on the other hand you might only pay a penny or fraction of a penny for it). 

That being said,  we can price everything in the world - and we can measure them in whatever currency -  dollars, bitcoins, McDonald's double cheeseburgers,  whatever

___
With that established,  I see the wealthiest people in the world controlling let's say 90% of the wealth (though it could be 99% or 50%, I'm not sure) 

Anyway, they have expenses like the rest of rest of us, spending money on their mansions,  yachts,  kids Harvard tuition,  etc,  in this way money is flowing outwards.
I see at like a rain cloud,  pouring down rain. 

To bring the money back in,  they create economic bubbles (and some of these may be economically ""ripe"" or even just happen on their own (but they certainly could create a bubble or make it stronger (refer to US housing bubble which was fueling in 99-00 by policies which put more buying pressure on homes,  thus predictably causing the price to rise (supply and demand). 
These wealthy people know there is going to be a bubble,  so they buy the assets early on. 
The thing is,  everyone gets richer when the price goes up (like US real estate did,  and peaked in 2007). But the wealthy also know to sell (or even to short at that point). In this way they “cash out."" The masses lose money in the crash,  but they have cashed out and locked in their profits. 

To complete my raincloud analogy,  when they spend money,  it's like the cloud raining,  and then by using bubbles, it's like the raincloud re-absorbing (and by doing so,  they consistently retain (or increase)  their wealth). 


This is just a rough outline, but I have been thinking about this for years.

0,1316687643.0,"Hey guys I'm currently undergoing my thesis involving the behavior of futures prices in the Australian electricity markets to new announcements/events.

For those that are interested here is a little background information (otherwise just skip past this block for my actual question):

>Electricity is quite a tricky commodity as it is very volatile due to its non-storability. It's too expensive to store and so its essentially delivered upon purchase. As a result, futures can't fundamentally be priced using a standard cost of carry equation. Prices are driven by supply/demand and demand fluctuate quite a bit with an underlying driver of seasonality (higher demand in summer and winter).

>The predictive power of Electricity futures in the past have shown to be quite bad - the prices at 1 quarter before spot (they will converge to spot at maturity to the average daily spot price of the quarter at the end of the quarter) are quite off. This is quite evident during outages (from power stations) - for example the 2007 droughts in Queensland forced power stations to be turned off as there was insufficient water to keep them cool. 

>The reason why prices increase so high during high demand is because the cost of supply increases exponentially as maximum capacity is reached - generators resort to turning on expensive peaking plants (plants that run during peak times).

So basically my methodology is comparing historical futures data to spot price data. I will be looking at it bilaterally - 

1) Looking at price movements and trying to link them back to events/announcements

2) Looking at events/announcements and seeing if the futures market responded and how they responded

To do this I'm thinking of using an event study method because it seems like the most suitable method in achieving some form of quantitative result. However I was wondering of anyone else here could recommend any alternative econometric methods that I could look into? Cheers.

EDIT: I mistakenly wrote that the futures price converge to the average daily price - the futures price actually converges to the average of the daily price of that quarter at the end of the quarter.",PEAK

Masayoshi Son is finally disclosing the damage from SoftBank Group Corp.’s bets on WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.
The Japanese investment powerhouse on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years -- about $6.5 billion --after writing down the value of a string of marquee investments. It swallowed a charge of 497.7 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for WeWork, whose spectacular implosion turned the once high-flying shared-office startup into a Silicon Valley punchline.


The losses call into question the billionaire founder Son’s deal-making approach just as he’s trying to raise an even larger successor to his $100 billion Vision Fund. The investment vehicle had been a driver of profit growth at SoftBank, contributing over $14 billion in mostly paper gains over the past two years. The shrinking valuation of Uber and WeWork, once among the brightest stars in the SoftBank constellation, also raises the prospects of more writedowns in the Vision Fund’s portfolio with its high exposure to businesses that prioritize growth over profitability.
“Son’s handling of WeWork raises some fundamental questions about his investment strategy that need to be addressed,” Jefferies Group senior analyst Atul Goyal said ahead of the earnings release. “There will be more failed investments in the future, how does he plan to handle them?”


The operating loss was 704.4 billion yen in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement. That easily surpassed the 230.8 billion yen average of analysts’ projections, and compared with a 705.7 billion yen profit a year earlier. Its signature Vision Fund -- the world’s single largest pool of startup investments -- reported a 970.3 billion yen loss in the quarter.


SoftBank reported 537.9 billion yen of unrealized losses in a plethora of investments from Uber to WeWork. Analysts had predicted a charge to be in excess of $5 billion and as much as $7 billion. The co-working startup was valued at $7.8 billion at the end of September -- a precipitous fall from about $47 billion in January.


Late last month, WeWork secured a $9.5 billion rescue package from SoftBank, a deal that handed 80% of the company to the Japanese conglomerate. That’s on top of the more than $10 billion SoftBank and its Vision Fund have already invested into the co-working giant. SoftBank has said it didn’t get a majority of voting rights, meaning its troubled investee will be treated as an associate, not a subsidiary -- potentially keeping its balance sheet free of some $22 billion of debt and $47 billion in looming lease-payment obligations.


The deal includes $5 billion in new financing and an acceleration of a $1.5 billion existing commitment. SoftBank will also offer to buy as much as $3 billion from existing shareholders. WeWork’s founder Adam Neumann left the company’s board as part of the package, replaced by SoftBank executive and newly appointed Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure.",HES

Technical analysis is not intended to be predictive of future price moves. It's a method of risk management that, primarily, allows you to identify asymmetric bets. Their usefulness has much less to do with ""self fulfilling prophecies"" and other mumbo jumbo.

Please excuse the entry-level explanations, we all know how the bond market works here, but I'm at work and don't really have time to modify it right now. This was also written last Thursday, treasuries have moved even higher still since then.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982. The Reagan Administration, in their ever-prescient wisdom, enacted SEC Rule 10b-18, creating a safe harbor whereby corporations could buy back their own stocks. This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

4) How do you feel about Donald Trump? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZ5e94QnWk",HES
0,1474318665.0,"TL;DR **that sell-side to buy-side career path is disappearing**

Asset managers intend to cut their analyst research budgets by 30 per cent, heaping more pain on the investment banking industry that has already been forced to make thousands of people redundant on the back of falling profitability.

The sharp reduction in how much fund houses are willing to pay for research will be felt most strongly in Europe, where asset managers plan to halve how much they spend on sellside research, according to a poll of 30 global asset management companies and six investment banks.

The cuts to research budgets, which are estimated to be worth $15bn a year, will trigger further job cuts for analysts and the potential elimination of entire research divisions, according to banking and investment experts.

The cuts are creating seismic changes for investment banks, which are having to reshape their operations.

Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive of Quinlan & Associates, the consultancy that carried out the survey, and former head of Asia-Pacific equities strategy at Deutsche Bank, said: “So much research is redundant or unused.

“The buyside does not need 30 brokers to give them the same report.

“Job cuts [among bank analysts] are happening, but not at the pace or speed that it needs to. There is no doubt [banks] will have to reduce costs further. Lesser-rated analysts will be on their way out.”

A separate poll of 2,200 asset management companies carried out last month by BCA Research, an independent research provider, found the number of analyst reports being produced will fall by a fifth, leading to a significant reduction in headcount within banks’ research teams.

Brijesh Malkan, a former Legal & General fund manager and a director at BCA Research, estimates the average portfolio manager receives 500 analyst reports a day. He said: “Eliminating information overload is probably the biggest thing asset managers are looking for.

“Asset managers were receiving 200 pieces of content on Facebook on a weekly basis. That has already halved over the past three months. If you are the 20th-rated analyst on Goldman Sachs’s telecommunications team, you probably need to be looking for a job pretty quickly.”

The drop in asset managers’ research budgets has been driven by new European rules that have forced fund companies to provide a clear budget for research costs to their investors. Previously asset managers paid for research as part of a bundled mix of services that included payments for equity or fixed income trading.

The new regulatory regime has made investment groups question how much research from analysts or brokers is truly worth.

A senior executive at one of Europe’s biggest fund houses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the company has already reduced how much it spends on research. “The likelihood of asset managers paying less for research from sellside analysts is high, especially in Europe. Paying less has already been happening, at least for the for bigger, global players with more purchasing power,” he said.

Other large fund companies are turning to high-quality independent research providers, or doing more research in-house, rather than relying on bank analysis that comes with unclear pricing policies.

Banks have already started to change their business models in response to these changes, but many still support armies of analysts. Banking stocks are currently covered by 465 teams of bank researchers, while telecoms and IT are covered by 283 teams, according to Extel, the data provider.

These pressures have prompted some analysts to move from banking into asset management, according to recruiters and industry insiders.

Earlier this month Huw van Steenis, the well-known analyst at Morgan Stanley, announced he will join Schroders, the UK’s largest listed asset manager.

This followed Alberto Gallo’s departure from the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he was a macro credit strategist, and Gavin Phillips’ decision to leave Jefferies, where he was head of sales trading. Both joined New York-based hedge fund companies earlier this year.

An asset management researcher, who last year worked as a banking analyst, said the drop in research spending by fund companies has generated considerable “nervousness” in investment banks’ research teams.

He added: “There is definitely pressure on the sellside. We are having more meetings with [banking analysts] around how much we want to pay; those conversations will be happening across the industry. There is definitely a squeeze.”",HES

Anyway, I am majoring in Mathematics/Applied Mathematics/Statistics. I have scoured through many of the course lists at all 3 of these schools, and many allow for students to take courses in various disciplines as long as they're relatively math intensive.

I took one class which involved creating pro formas with projections for a rolling 4 year period.  While making these projections, we made assumptions based on sales (the 'business' was a computer company in the early years of consumer PCs).  So we did things from buying a factory (and managing factory capacity) to R&D to marketing.  All of these inputs were then put into a simulation program which 'judged' the efficacy of our inputs (advertising, capacity, production of different computers, sales tactics, # of employees, basically every aspect of a fully vertically integrated computer company).

The assumptions that some of my group members wanted to make were, to be blunt, pretty cringey.  I'll cut them slack on the first one since we had no historical data, but when we arrived in the 3rd-4th periods, people still had no idea what to do.  Manufacturing had 'decent' data on sales growth and whatnot and she would just insist on raising capacity by an arbitrary number.  That's essentially what it boiled down into.  People wanting to make assumptions based on arbitrary bases.  

I suggested we do a 'test period' where we make calculated moves and see how that affects our bottom line, basically to feel out the simulation and to see how the inputs would affect the output.  They were basically confused as to why we'd want to do that and basically showed no understanding of a computer program/its input-output style of logic.

So all of this culminated into horrible pro forma projections.  We'd base sales off of nothing and just assume that they'd increase by 20% every period, or some other arbitrary amount.  No one had any idea how to create good and realistic assumptions.  We'd talk about R&D and no one even thought about just looking up the prices of different R&D ventures (prices were listed per R&D upgrade) to see how much we'd spend based on what kinds of things we wanted.  Instead, they'd rather 'budget' a $10M expense for it in one year, when we could literally just see what upgrades we wanted and how much that'd cost.  AKA basing their assumptions off of nothing.

I don't have experience working with professionals on this too much.  I can tell teachers and whatnot who have done this for years often cover all the bases when they speak and they talk like they know how pro formas affect different line items and whatnot.  They display extensive knowledge of how changes can affect different areas of financial statements.  My current finance teacher with a PhD in math is a good example of this.  He recognizes that if you increase sales over a period of time, you need the infrastructure/capacity to handle it, how the increases in the capacity affect the bottom line, the new employees required to handle the increased capacity (unless you replace labor with capital).  Etc etc.  It's hard to really explain but it's very noticeable when talking to him that he really understands whats going on with financial statements and how 1 change can affect more than 1 other line item.

Contrast that to a student (and yes, my professor has obviously been doing it much longer) but it's alarming how little people can accomplish when they aren't given flat out what happens and how it affects everything.  In the same vein, many students cannot properly do a sensitivity analysis, where they make assumptions about the future based on differing levels of activity and how it affects the bottom line.  Many, without guidance, cannot simply assume that you'd want maybe 3 different environments, 1 with low demand, 1 with normal demand, 1 with extraordinary demand (obviously you could get much more in depth).  Or that you'd want to obviously account for necessary increases in capacity if you want to be able to handle the increase in demand/sales.  

It's hard to articulate properly but what I've boiled it down to is an inability to apply logic.  The same thing happens when you give someone a problem with no instructions.  They have no idea where to begin or what to do.  

If there is anyone here, such as teachers or recruiters, who regularly come into contact with young students/professionals who are entering the work force, have you noticed this 'phenomenon'?  I don't like to go off personal experience too much but it's almost universal at my school that students have trouble dealing with making assumptions and applying it to pro forma projections.  

Which is why I've been thinking about creating a 'training program' designed to help students go through the process of making assumptions about the future and seeing the outcome based on their assumptions.  The point isn't to develop people's 'future telling' abilities but more nuanced than that--to help people apply logic and help them go through the process of understanding a scenario and what the goals are, what the ramifications are for certain decisions, etc.  I know it's a vague concept but I do have a creative way of designing this training program in mind, but I want to know if it's something that would really be necessary or not.  I would obviously program it myself and my programming background has actually helped me a lot in finance, since I look at a pro forma basically like an extensively programmed Excel spreadsheet/a general program that accepts inputs and spits out an output based on an underlying function.

Any ideas or thoughts?

Tl;dr:  I've noticed students suck at making assumptions/applying logic so I've been thinking about creating a program to help 'train' students to think in the way a business executive would who is planning for the future.  Being able to make proper assumptions is pivotal in the planning aspect of running a business and it's often why businesses are so successful--because they always have a plan for any circumstance/situation that might arise.  And this plan is helpful because they know, today, if something happens in the future, what they must do, how it will affect their pro formas, and what it could mean for the company.  And it works because it's realistic and accounts for the whole machine that a business is.  They understand that it's an intricate machine with cogs that turn and, in turn, make other cogs spin. I've noticed a lot of students struggle with this process and I've been thinking about creating a program to help people think through the process.  

EDIT:  Also, are there any similar programs you guys have seen and your opinions on them if you've tried them before.  

To bring this full circle, the whole point is to understand business better and to be able to make better business decisions using better data.  So it'd all focus on financial statements and would be from the perspective of a business/from a business perspective, not so much other fields).

And please excuse the hodge podge anecdote, it was simply to demonstrate the kind of thinking I've seen from other people and how it contributes to an overall lack of understanding.  The simulation we used in that class is what I'd model my training program off of but with many improvements.  So the one being trained would probably act from the perspective of a business owner/CFO.

0,1345844055.0,"First, assume the S&P100 index has performed like this on the first 3 days of the month:

    day   open      close     return (abs)    return (%)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    1     574.19    562.51    -11.68          -2.03
    2     564.56    570.72      6.16           1.09
    3     571.99    572.93      0.94           0.16

In other words, ""the market"" index went down $11.68 or -2.03% on day 1. Now asssume that I have bought and sold the following stocks on each of these 3 days:


    day   stock     open     close    return (abs)    return (%)
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    1     HPQ       40.81    40.14    -0.67           -1.64
    2     FDX       89.79    87.89    -1.90           -2.12
    3     PEP       63.49    63.24    -0.25           -0.39

So on day 1, I bought and sold HPQ for a return of -$0.67 or -1.64%. I now want to calculate, in %, how my trades performed against the market:

    day    market return (%)    my return (%)    excess return (%)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1      -2.03                -1.64             0.39  (-1.64 - -2.03)
    2       1.09                -2.12             3.21
    3       0.16                -0.39            -0.55
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    total  -0.78                -4.15            -3.37  (-4.15 - -0.78)

For instance, on day 1 the market (S&P100 index) went down 1.64% but the stock I bought only went down 1.64%. In other words, my trade ""outperformed"" the market by 0.39%. When totalling, the market lost 0.78% during the three days, but my trades lost -4.15%. The way I interpret this, my trades underperformed 3.37% against the market.

Alternatively, if I take the first (574.19) and last (572.93) price of the market indexfund, the market only declined ((572.93 - 574.19) / 574.19) * 100 = -0.22%. Based on this number, my trades underperformed the market by -3.37 - -0.22 = -3.15%

**Question 1** How do the 2 market performances that I calculated (-0.78% and -0.22%) relate to each other?

**Question 2** How do I correctly culculate the relative performance of my trades against the market? Is is -3.37% or -3.15%? And if it's neither, how do I calculate with how many % my trading outperformed (or underperformed) the market?",HPQ

Everyone seems so up in arms about HFT and claim that it is an unfair tax on regular market participants. Pretending for a moment that this claim is in fact true, why is IEX's ""speed bump"" (i.e., the slowing down of orders to prevent HFT's from executing some sort of latency based arb strategy) a solution to the problem (again acknowledging that there is one whether its true or not). It seems to me that HFT's rely on relative speed, not absolute speed vs regular institutional investors. So even if there is a bump down in all speeds, wouldn't the fact that HTF's employ faster algorithms and collocate closer to the exchange still make them relatively faster than institutional investors and thus able to execute their strategy. 

Also, another problem I had with the IEX model was that HFT's pay money to the exchange for access to the direct feed which is faster than the SIP. They do this because they can't beat the orders executed on the exchange that they pay to look at (this is true because the nature of the direct feed is that it is historic - the orders have already be executed) but see if there are overflow orders that would get executed on another exchange and then take the opposite position of the overflow order on the other exchange to make risk-less profit. So my question is how can one exchange's speed bump (pretending here too that a speed bump is a solution) prevent HFT's from executing their latency strategies on other exchanges (i.e., beating the overflow orders to other exchanges).

0,1393392381.0,"This is all hypothetical and I'm not in a position to do this, but something made me think about it the other day.  

As an example, let's say I work in the corporate HQ for a large multinational pizza chain and have access to sales information about all our stores that is not available to anyone outside of the company.  Sales are exceeding expectations by a wide margin across the chain and it is a near certainty that our stock will jump up after we release our earnings results.  I notice that stores where we have identified as being nearby a certain competitor are lagging way behind the rest of our stores in sales growth.  My company is so large that a very high percentage of this competitor's stores have one of our stores nearby.  This effect is much larger in markets that we share with this particular competitor than in markets that we share with other competitors.

Market research has shown that customers prefer the competitor's product to ours.  This, combined with the information I have showing that sales are lagging at our stores in markets where we both have a store, makes me believe that the growth that I'm seeing across my chain is being mostly captured by my competitor in those markets where we compete.

If I go out and buy a bunch of stock options in my company's competitor based on a conclusion that I drew from information that was only available to me because I work for a competitor, would that be considered insider trading?",INFO

Here's the example I came up with - your golf buddy reveals some insider information.  You take this info and perform a series of analysis that make you realize how this information will play out over the course of a few days once it becomes public.  You put a trade order into your system, but tell it not to execute until a full 2 seconds after the announcement.  Didn't you use non-public information which you had a duty not to disclose (according to recent court opinions on golf buddy insider info?) But at the same time you didn't have a duty to disclose the results of your analysis because you aren't part of that company.

Edit:  I did some digging once I learned about the idea of ""time to absorption"", then the answer is a ""yes"", that it's theoretically possible to commit an insider trading crime after the information becomes public.  The short answer is that certain kinds of information require the public some time to absorb and an insider may not trade until that time period has expired.  The courts and SEC have not established a specific time period, but there was one case in which the courts rules that 9 days needed to have transpired before the public could have fully absorbed the information.",INFO

>Graduating in the spring with a double major in Finance & Accounting (non-target, state school, southeast/midwest)

>3.3 Finance GPA

>3.2 Accounting GPA

>3.0 Overall

>Wealth Management/Equity Research Internship

>President of school investment club 

>VP of Entrepreneurship club 

>Experience with DCF Modeling, Bloomberg, database lookup functions

All GPAs are likely to increase, especially the major GPAs, before I graduate (my GPA is low primarily due to a health condition which has been taken care of but the damage has been done). I'm growing increasingly concerned with my prospects upon graduation. Public Accounting firms thought I was too interested in Finance by my club/internship experiences (sometimes they even flat out said it during the interview) and the only finance positions our university has listed through our career site are sales-oriented (I picked up accounting to avoid that fate). 

Honestly, what kind of chance do I have at finding a financial analyst-style position? I realize the ambiguity in that job title but I ultimately want something that pays well (i do have loans), does not require me to sell a product or try to persuade potential clients, and will challenge me to constantly learn and apply what I know.

**1st Update:** Guys I just want to thank you all for your advice. It's been a rough week (3 rejections on Monday to start the week off) and I just needed my perspective to be brought back to earth. You guys are wonderful and I appreciate all forms of advice, no matter how dry/realistic; I know the market a bit better than most college grads but clearly stress is blinding my view at the moment. 

**2nd Update:** I think you guys are getting hung up on the idea that I don't want to do sales because I don't want interaction. I don't want to do sales because I don't think it's an admirable profession. 

**3rd Update:** I guess I should clarify this because I feel like there's been some miscommunication. When I say I don't want to work in sales, I'm talking about selling life insurance for a company like Northwest Mutual. I'd kill for a S&T job with a BB firm. I think we can all agree those roles are worlds apart from each other. 

**Final Update:** Thanks again to everyone that provided meaningful feedback that I can use moving forward. I always welcome criticism so long as it's constructive and I can take something from it.

**I made this post on /r/investing but was hopping to get some additional feedback on this sub.**

I have made posts in the past about my financial tool (www.alphanook.net), but it has been completely reworked and I figured that it might be time to get some more feedback. 

general info: 
I started building a tool after failing to find something easily accessible online to help quantify and evaluate my portfolio's diversification. 

right now my site has one key function; optimizing capital distribution among stocks utilizing a Sharpe ratio algorithm and is heavily influenced by modern portfolio theory. 

Any feedback is appreciated, but most importantly I would like to know:

1. Would you guys actively use this tool?

2. If not why? 

3. If you would use it, would you pay for additional features?


Keep in mind Alphanook is not a finished product and the interface is not yet finalized, so you may run into a couple bugs on the site.

0,1416356788.0,"Just for context, I attend a target school but my cumulative GPA is low, a 3.6. In my freshman year I had no idea what I was doing and ended up doubling up in math because I wanted something 'technical.' I'm good at math, but not exceptional. I got As in Calc 1 and 2, but I got a B in calc 3 and a B+ in Linear Algebra. So now I'm majoring in economics and math and minoring in symbolic systems with a 3.745 major GPA. Naturally I can't sit and make excuses for my GPA when it comes to Resume screening. I also got a 2370 in my SAT, which is within the BB range.

In terms of extracurriculars I hold a bureaucratic leadership position in the student government. I have 3 summers of finance related internships that I acquired through contacts. One was large but not very prestigious financial services company, an boutique investment bank and a hedge-fund. I speak multiple languages and I can code in Python, STATA, VBA and Matlab. I also know that these skills aren't necessarily relevant to finance, but I enjoy coding.

Generally, I'm extremely interested in finance and I have an intuitive understanding of financial concepts. I guess my first questions is, is a 3.6 cumulative passable for recruiting in finance? I network, but I haven't really stood out at any of the info-sessions as of yet. My follow up emails to the last BB I networked at also went badly and I didn't get an interview. The only interviews I've had so far have been with MBB (consulting).

This leads on to my second question. My school is on the West Coast so all the recruiting is carried out by technology M&A and healthcare groups. I'm far more interested in Sales and Trading. None of the analysts I've emailed so far have been able to put me in touch with the New York Office and I think I pissed off the last analyst I emailed about this, because I was getting blunt one liners. All my classes are geared towards sales and trading and my background knowledge in corporate finance is sorely lacking. How exactly could I go about getting in touch with someone from the New York offices without having to bug analysts?

The last big info-session of the fall semester was yesterday and I got one business card from a guy I said about 1 line to who also happens to work in an office that isn't in my vicinity. Again, not trying to make excuses but there were more than 50 people to 2 analysts and a VP.",INFO

0,1339533365.0,"Hi,
I’m building a dcf model of mcdonalds and my terminal value is coming out waaaay too high. It’s almost 3x current market value. I’ve looked online for some comparable WACC calculations to see if I’m screwing anything up badly, and all the WACCs I’ve come across for MCD have been quite a bit higher. The problem is, they seem to be calculated improperly, using the wrong beta, way higher cost of debt, or different risk free rate. I’ll list my assumptions and maybe you can point out what’s out of wack with my wacc.

I’m currently using a beta of 0.5145 based on 1 year returns vs the S&P 500. I checked wolfram alpha and the 2 and 5 year betas are virtually identical at about 0.51, so I don’t think the beta is wrong. The risk free rate I am using in the capm model is the 10 year at 1.66%. The expected market return I am using is 6.45% from the quarterly CFO survey. Perhaps I should use implied expected return instead? For the cost of debt I am using the 2011 weighted average debt from the annual report which is 4.2%. These inputs result in 1.66 + 0.5145(6.45-1.66) or about 4.12% as a cost of equity. Given a 0.1354 debt/equity ratio and effective tax rate of 31.3% I end up with a WACC of 3.98% or so.

If I use the 30 year bond rate of 2.77 instead of the 10 yearI still get over 2x current market value for my DCF value. The WACC just seems very low. Lowering  my long-term growth rate expectations does lower the terminal value, but it still seems very high. If anyone can point out where I might have screwed up, please let me know.

I’m trying to figure out what the next best course of action is. My current firm is sponsoring me for the series 7 and series 66 and I’ll be taking those within a month.

So I have a few questions: 1) Should I start applying now to commercial banking, corporate finance, pwm entry roles or should I search for an internship at these sectors before applying for entry roles? 2) For entry roles at F500, are the offices usually in NYC? 3) Which roles in F500 corporate finance are the easiest to break into? 4) Any chance of getting into rotational programs at this point with my stats? Also, does Corp Fin F500 usually prefer finance majors or accounting majors? 5) Would it give me a tiny advantage having the 7/66 for a PWM entry role at a BB? 6) I understand commercial banking is more relevant to businesses, but what are the specific names of the roles in commercial banking? And does it help having series 7/66, what is the beginning salary?

Basically, given my stats, what would be the next course of action to take for 2-3 years until I go back to get a MBA?

&nbsp;



Starting Teetor's recommendation to calculate a spread ratio on price rather than returns, if I use OLS and set intercepts to zero, the coefficients seem to make sense:

The price of W does seem to be roughly 1.6 times A. 

lm(WPrice ~ APrice + 0) 
Coefficient APrice = 1.61


lm(formula = APrice ~ WPrice + 0)
Coefficient WPrice = .6181


While close these coefficients are not inverses of each other.


&nbsp;


Just for fun doing the same on ADelta / WDelta:

lm(formula = WDelta ~ ADelta + 0)
Coefficient ADelta = 1.244  

Ok that makes sense W does seem more volatile than A.



&nbsp;

lm(formula = ADelta ~ WDelta + 0)
Coefficient WDelta = .3226

This time we are pretty far off from WDelta being the inverse of ADelta  1/.3226 = 3.099814





&nbsp;



&nbsp;







Now in the interest of doing things the way Teetor recommends I will use TLS.


r <- prcomp( ~ APrice + WPrice)

slope <- r$rotation[2,1] / r$rotation[1,1] ##Slope

slope 
r$center[2] - slope*r$center[1] ##Intercept

Coefficient APrice = 4.911259
Intercept APrice = -125.4736


&nbsp;



r2 <- prcomp( ~ WPrice + APrice)

slope2 <- r2$rotation[2,1] / r2$rotation[1,1] ##Slope

slope2 
r2$center[2] - slope2*r2$center[1] ##Intercept

Coefficient WPrice = .2036138
Intercept WPrice = 25.54815


&nbsp;


Both of these result in relatively decent fits, as well the coefficients are inverses of each other, 1/.2036138 = 4.911259.



&nbsp;


The inability to set the intercept to 0 is confusing me with these coefficients however.  I know I could center the two price series around 0 as done in the article, but I am still going to get the same coefficients.  What exactly is being said here?  According to Teetor the beta produced by the TLS is the hedge ratio, but it seems illogical just looking at the two curves that I should purchase almost 5 times as many units of W to hedge A.


&nbsp;


Doing the same with the Deltas:

r <- prcomp( ~ ADelta + WDelta)

slope <- r$rotation[2,1] / r$rotation[1,1] ##Slope

slope 
r$center[2] - slope*r$center[1] ##Intercept

Coefficient ADelta = 2.56133
Intercept ADelta = -.243163

&nbsp;


r2 <- prcomp( ~ WDelta + ADelta)

slope2 <- r2$rotation[2,1] / r2$rotation[1,1] ##Slope

slope2 
r2$center[2] - slope2*r2$center[1] ##Intercept

Coefficient WDelta = .3904217
Intercept WDelta = .09493611


&nbsp;


Again, inverses, but with the intercept != 0 I am not really sure how to interpret these here.  


&nbsp;




If I apply these coefficients to the formula in appendix C on page 13 I get:

NB,t = Beta(PA,t / PB,t)  
.390422*(45/34.45) = .509985

I am thinking the author used OLS as he mentions the intercepts being assumed to be set to 0.

I am interpreting that according to this model .509985(100) extra units of W should be purchased to offset location A.  This isn't too far off from the OLS model on price where the intercepts = 0 suggesting that the price of A is roughly .6 of W on average, but I want to be sure that I am interpreting the results correctly.  


&nbsp;


Why is it that I would get a seemingly logical answer using the formula from appendix C using TLS, but the Betas from using TLS on price alone seem so out of whack?


Do I have any glaring errors in my understanding here?


If we are looking to offset risk in location A where we are not able to buy forward with location W, and they are the same commodity is this even a common practice in risk management?  


Is there a better way to do this?

And this number is an especially big number for a company that made $385M revenue in 2012 since this company also lost $396M.

I know making loses is part of the R&D process and tsla might start the reap the fruits of the money spent on R&D with its new products. Lets be over optimistic and say that they will be making 100x more money than they used to by next year this time and will generate a revenue of $40B. $110B shy from GM's revenue in year 2012. And also in order to generate this revenue they would have to sell 363,000 cars(based on model s85p price of 110).

0,1428031121.0,"Hey... Throwaway account obviously.  Curious about any educated thoughts on distressed whole loan trading funds?  

I actually have an interview coming up with a well established fund (several billion AUM, >20 year track record) in their whole loan trading group but I've never had that much exposure to RE let alone whole loans.  

For background, I'm an associate in trading at bulge bracket.  Been here for 4 years and focus on cross-product portfolio trading (generally speaking I work with a lot of your vanilla products: equity, both listed and otc eq options, corp and conv debt though only limited amounts in the distressed or structured facility space, and a bit with cds and var swaps generally with respect to risk/hedging).

Questions I had were:

- I see most white papers out there are usually by funds talking about the huge amount of distressed whole loans still on balance sheets, does this indicate despite where we are in the credit cycle there is still ample room for these funds to find value?

- The fund high level model focuses on picking up distressed whole loans, service to performing, and securitization for offloading.  Is this the standard approach these PE funds take?

- From what I understand, lending banks generally package bundles of whole loans for clusters of sales in which there's a multi-day bidding process.  Can anyone shed further light on the details of this process?

- What kind of implications can a sustained rising interest rate environment have on these funds?  The fund has a quant desk focused on managing IR risk through what I assume are OTC IRS's, but on the loan market as a whole do periods of higher default rates (usually associated with rising interest rates) negatively impact performance of these funds?

What is the difference between an asset swap spread and a midswap spread?
If a 10-year bond yields 3% and the 10-year IRS is at 2% mid, the midswap spread will be 1%. I know how to hedge a bond. If I pay the fixed rate on the swap, I now have a yield of Libor+100.
I understand this only works if your bond is at par.

Hence, asset swaps. Let's say my bond quotes 110. How can an asset swap help me hedge these 10%? 

What's the correct formula for determining its price and how are they used in real life? Can you use them to get synthetic exposures like you would do with CDS?

I apologize if this is convoluted or unclear.  


In 1999 I received stock options for the company that I worked for.  In 2000 my company was sold and all of my stock options vested and were converted to the new company’s stock.  Then in 2004 that company merged and that stock was converted again to another company’s stock.  Here are the numbers
 


Company A 233 shares

Conversion to Company B =109 shares

Conversion to Company C =123 shares.




**Company A history: 2000**
I think my original vestment price was $79 per share for Company A.  When the stock converted to Company B the valuation was $77.50 per share and a transfer rate of .467 shares to 1 share of company B and company B stock was valued at $142.50/share

**Company B history: 2004**
I can’t find the share price for Company B back in 2004 but it was around $28.  When Company B was sold to Company C the agreed upon share price was $27.35 with a transfer formula of 1.1242

I just sold my Company C shares in 2013 for $24.44 a share.  My question, what is my original purchase price?  Do I report the $79 per share from 2000?  Do I use the $77.50 or do I use the $27.35 for when my Company B stock Converted to Company C.

I know I have a loss, I am just trying to figure out how big of one.

Oil investors may regret urging companies to cough up cash now instead of investing in growth for later as the dearth of exploration is setting the stage for an unprecedented crude price spike, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Companies have been compelled to focus on boosting returns and shareholder distributions at the expense of capital expenditures aimed at finding new supplies, analysts including Neil Beveridge wrote in a note Friday. That’s causing reserves at major producers to fall and the industry’s reinvestment ratio to plunge to the lowest in a generation, paving the way for oil prices to surpass records reached last decade, according to Bernstein.

“Investors who had egged on management teams to reign in capex and return cash will lament the underinvestment in the industry,” the analysts wrote. “Any shortfall in supply will result in a super-spike in prices, potentially much larger than the $150 a barrel spike witnessed in 2008.”

The world’s oil majors including [Royal Dutch Shell Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RDSA:NA) and [BP Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BP%2F:LN) navigated the price crash of 2014 by cutting costs, selling assets and taking on debt to help satisfy investors with hefty dividends. The biggest, [Exxon Mobil Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XOM:US), was [punished by shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P5A1YH6VDKHT) earlier this year after compounding disappointing results with a massive spending plan and a lack of buybacks.

The oversupply of crude globally in recent years has masked “chronic underinvestment,” Bernstein said in the report. Oil has rebounded to the highest in more than three years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies started curbing output at the beginning of last year to trim a global glut. The producers aim now to [pump more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-26/opec-supply-buffer-shrinks-as-it-answers-calls-to-pump-more-oil) to help cool the market, but disruptions from Libya to Venezuela are keeping prices elevated.

Proven reserves of the world’s top oil companies have fallen by more than 30 percent on average since 2000, with only Exxon and BP showing an improvement, helped by acquisitions, Bernstein said. Meanwhile, more than 1 billion people will urbanize in Asia over the next two decades and this will drive demand for cars, as well as air travel, road freight and plastics that also require oil, according to Bernstein.

“If oil demand continues to grow to 2030 and beyond, the strategy of returning cash to shareholders and underinvesting in reserves will only turn out to sow the seeds of the next super-cycle,” the analysts wrote. “Companies which have barrels in the ground to produce, or the services to extract them, will be the ones to own and those who do not will be left behind.”

Brent oil rallied to an all-time high above $147 a barrel in 2008 as booming demand growth and a lack of readily available resources fueled a synchronized surge across commodities that was dubbed the super-cycle. The global benchmark was at $76.78 a barrel as of 11:57 a.m. in London on Friday, up about 60 percent in the past year.",ICE

My SO is managing a rural franchise selling ice cream at the moment and was offered the business in an informal verbal way for ""about $10,000"" and says it ""probably gets $80,000 profit per annum"".

The franchise has been on the market for 5 years, and has a severe staffing issue, where they have had to pay fuel and accommodation for my SO to drive 100 or so miles to work there. The position doesn't require any qualifications.

The businesses two main ice cream freezer equipment pieces are old and need replacement (about $20,000), and she claims the reason it hasn't been able to sell for 5 years is because it is in a rural area and that it needs a refurbishment (another $20,000) which the franchisee has to fund. She refuses to acknowledge all of these other costs, especially royalties and the fact that she's signing herself into a 5 year contract. She wants to go to university next year in another state, but with the staffing issues, she will almost definitely be working there 5 days a week for as long as she owns it.

The franchisor says they will help finance her, but with no competition from banks (because what bank will lend $50k to an 18 year old without an established credit rating) I fear she's going to lock herself into a high interest loan and she will be bankrupt within a year.

>There is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned portfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or shouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-neutral portfolio? The answer is no. A dollar-neutral portfolio is self financing, meaning the cash you get from selling short pays for the purchase of the long securities, so the financing cost (due to the spread between the credit and debit interest rates) is small and can be neglected for many backtesting purposes. Meanwhile, the mar- gin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the risk-free rate rF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return minus the contribution from the credit interest) is R, and the risk- free rate is rF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe ratio is R + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free rate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to your stock positions.  

>Similarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does not hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the risk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess returns, since you do not have financing costs in this case, either. In general, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy returns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs financing cost.  

________

Edit: I emailed the author and he was kind enough to explain

>Sharpe ratio requires excess return as input. Excess return means raw return minus the funding (interest) cost. For e.g. if you have long $1M IBM, you need to pay interest on that $1M. (Another way to think of this is that your $1M cash could have been generating the same interest if you don't use it for buying IBM.) So the excess return of your $1M IBM is the raw return of IBM minus the interest cost. However, a dollar neutral position is self-financing: the cash earned from the short side is used to purchase the long side. Hence there is no funding cost, and there is no reason to deduct that in computing excess returns. You are generating returns out of thin air, and not incurring any real interest or opportunity cost in holding position. Anyway, with interest rate effectively 0 these days, such distinction hardly matters.

0,1387177297.0,"I am an undergrad in Finance, and I just started reading The Big Short by Michael Lewis. In the second chapter, he says:

>He came to a passage explaining why banks felt they needed credit default swaps at all. It wasn't immediately obivous--after all, the best way to avoid the risk of General Electirc's default on it debt was not to lend to General Electric in the first place. In the beginning, credit default swaps had been a tool for hedging. Some banks had loaned more than they wanted to General Electic because GE has asked for it, and they feared alienating a long-standing client; however another bank changed its mind about the wisdom of lending to GE at all. Very quickly, however, the new derivatives became tools for speculation: A lot of people wanted to make bets on the likelihood of GE's defaulting."" (pg. 30)
>

This brought up a question I had. Who in their right minds would buy a CDS against GE? Which brought upon a bigger question: Who in their right minds would buy a CDS against many of these large corporations? Is it purely speculative? Are there enough individual investors willing to bet against hundred-year-old companies that they buy wiliingly a CDS against large, out-standing companies such as GE? I find it hard to believe a large bank would buy CDSs against such companies. So when a bank decides to hedge against their risk against a company such as GE, Exxon, or Apple, is there a large bank on the other side buying up these CDSs? 

Also, I'm not entirely sure: are CDSs exchange traded, or OTC traded? If they were exchange traded, I can see how individual investors could be purswayed to invest in CDSs against these companies, but if they were OTC traded, how would they convince their contacts who -- I assume -- are much more informed than your average trader?

Much of my knowledge of finance is textbook quality, so I'm not sure of the ""here's the real world"" type answers, so don't assume anything might be too obvious. According to the quote above, it is speculators who are buying these, which I guess leads me to a tangent question: How much speculative buying goes on at large banks? I had assumed most of their buying was much more grounded in quantitative reasoning, and not speculation. Are these other large banks who are buying this on speculation? Could there possibly be other departments within the same bank who are willing to speculate on these CDSs and end up washing out the net hedge against the CDSs?

Sorry if I packed too many questions in one post, but this one little passage brought up a lot of questions for me that, honestly, I hadn't considered when reading the textbook definition of ""credit default swap."" ",JPM

HSBC is at 7 bps in their 3 month euro LIBOR submission but at 18 basis points in their 3 month euribor submission. The two theories I have so far are:

1. Different desks handle each submission and they are basically making up numbers to be in line with the others - this seems to be the case. But I'm still not sure why the rate differs.
2. One of numbers is from a subsidiary of some sort.
3. They are both funding in euros, but the sources they are allowed to use are different.

0,1339051768.0,"I kinda get this gist of this:

[*In February 2012, hedge fund insiders such as Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of Bruno Iksil, a trader for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and referred to as ""the London Whale"" in reference to the huge positions he was taking. Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of JPMorgan, who purchased the derivatives JPMorgan was selling in such high volume. Early reports were denied and minimized by the firm in an attempt to minimize exposure. Major losses, $2 billion, were reported by the firm in May, 2012 in relationship to these trades. The disclosure, which resulted in headlines in the media, did not disclose the exact nature of the trading involved, which remained in progress as of May 16, 2012 as J.P. Morgan's losses mount and other traders seek to profit or avoid losses resulting from J.P. Morgan's positions. The trades are possibly related to CDX IG 9, a credit default swap index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations that has been described as a ""derivative of a derivative"". On the company's emergency conference call, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the strategy was ""flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored"". The episode is being investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the FBI.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_JPMorgan_Chase_trading_loss#Trade_.231)

But, I'm just wondering where the money that they lost went. Where does the paper trail go or is that not disclosed? Also, if you could explain the situation and possible consequences of the trading loss in layman's terms that would be awesome.

0,1428421056.0,"Before you post; I am looking for good insight. I am a long time lurker, and I have wanted to ask this for sometime now. 

Background: I am currently working for one of the largest private MF companies in the world. I love the culture and I have been a consultant / wholesaler for about 3 years now, and with the company for nearly 5 years. (I am turning 26 in may, and I am licensed with a series 7 and 63). I currently live in Dallas, TX and have my entire life. My mother used to be one of the largest Overnight Portfolio Managers for the FHLB in the 90's. As a kid we used to go up to NYC usually once twice a year and visit the WTC's 84th floor Euro Trading desks to visit her Brokers Dealers. So ever since I was a kid I have wanted to Move to NYC, and be involved with Investments. 

Here I am now; I have a BS in management, and I am working on obtaining a my MBA and MS in Finance (Invesment Management Concentration) With rounding out to about 4 years of financial services sales experience, I would like to continue down the path of wholesaling and the sales career path. Whether it may be on a personal or institutional level, I enjoy the aspect of communicating to prospect regarding various investments, and service. I am about one year away from graduation. So I feel now is the time to begin this process, with researching and building communication in NYC. I am not afraid of moving, as I have wanted to do this my whole life. I want to work in NYC so bad that it hurts. One of my dreams has been to Wholesale for JPM, or Blackrock, I know a lot wish they could too, but I am looking at my big picture here.   

Any input would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for your time in reading my story. ",JPM

Basically, I'm confused about the role that most of these acts have played, and am having sort of a hard time finding explanations online. I know pretty well only about the last two: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is said to have allowed commercial and investment banks to merge, introducing volatility to commercial banks, as well as allowing the merger of institutions which then became ""too big to fail."" And the Commodity Futures Modernization Act seems to be mostly about preventing regulation of derivatives. But I'm quite confused as to the rest. Does anyone have any resources or wisdom they'd be able to share for me to understand their role? ",JPM

Wouldn't it be wise to liquidate as much as possible before it gets any worse at the moment? And potentially keep out until the market cools down? 

I know midstream companies aren't getting hit as hard as producers, and perhaps looking into natural gas plays for cheap stocks might a good idea, but I'd like to see what the the banks, or even macro funds, are doing in this market. 

Any pointers are a great help.",JPM

I always assumed they were just an opinion based on public information. I rarely learn anything by reading them, though sometimes they manage to put the dots together in ways that I hadn't considered.

If that's the case, why does it matter if, for instance, MS or JPM issues a report ahead of FB's IPO saying that they have changed their outlook on future earnings? The statement they were basing that opinion off of was public information. Any investor doing due diligence in their investments would have taken that into account.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation#Subprime_mortgage_boom

It says that the CDOs, despite being comprised of poorly rated MBSs were given ratings just as high as MBSs that were sound ""on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so 'uncorrelated'"". 

This means that, if you use the diagram to picture the process, the houses that default on the loans are located in highly varied areas of the country and thus are unlikely to all fail to provide a flow of cash at once, right? But if they did somehow all fail, then the investment would essentially stop yielding returns and thus be a failed investment, as a large part of it would be repossessed by banks. Right? 

It says, ""CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course."" I read the page of the FCIC report cited here but still don't really understand ... does this mean that in good times, debt that acts as your capital base is repaid more often and thus you acquire / are able to use more leverage to invest, whereas if the market reverses course, your capital base isn't being replenished by debt payments and thus you can't invest?

And if we imagine a particular situation that might act as an example of this, does that mean that if someone wants to take a second mortgage on their house, the financial institution that would usually do it would say ""yeah I can give you that second mortgage, after all, I've got capital which I can use as a base to leverage and give loans."" But then when a large number of these loans fail, the over-leveraged institutions don't have that capital any more and thus can't or won't give loans, at which point the market begins to shrink and the debt built on debt built on debt built on bad loans freezes the financial system up, because the CDOs are packaged into other investments which are held by banks and they're going bad so banks can't lend because a lack of capital base?

0,1426819799.0,"Hey /r/finance. If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

I’m heading off to get my MBA in the fall and wanted to get r/finance’s opinion on Mac vs. PC when it comes to financial modeling. A quick search on the sub shows that PC wins hands down when it comes to short cuts, though the posts were all a year ago (so I think before Excel 2016). I’m nowhere near a pro with excel, but my entire career has revolved around it so I’m definitely above average.

Would love to get everyone’s insight (especially if you've used Excel 2016). A couple main concerns I have:

1) Is there an equivalent for the “alt” key in Excel 2016? Concerned for shortcuts like alt+n+n (insert line chart), alt+n+v+t (pivot table), etc.


2) Is there a short cut for right click? Not sure what the button is called in PC, but shortcuts like “right click button”+f+f (formatting), “right click button”+s (paste special), etc.


3) Can you toggle between worksheets using control+page up/down?


4) If OS X doesn’t allow for any of the above, would I be able to do 99% of windows shortcuts through a parallel?


5) Any other concerns I should have?

To be honest, I would love to get a Mac (screens are beautiful, and a goal of mine is to learn how to code iPhone apps), but I definitely don’t want to sacrifice excel functionality as I’m likely recruiting for jobs that will heavily use it.

Thanks for the help!

I'm interested in quantitative finance, and my university offers quite a bit of math that I can see being applied to quant fields. They have a really good finance program, but it doesn't involve that much high-level math (aka it's just business calc).

Having looked at grad programs in quant finance, they seem to involve a lot of stochastic calculus, numerical analysis, and time series stuff.

**What I already know to take (descriptions given for non-clear ones)**

* Calculus I,II,III
* Mathematical Foundations 
 * Axiomatic systems and techniques of proof, in preparation for upper-level study in mathematics. Topics include: symbolic logic, boolean algebra, set theory, countable and uncountable sets, techniques of proof, functions and relations, mathematical induction, group axioms. Emphasis is on preparing the student to read and write mathematical proofs, and to work with abstract definition and axioms)
* Differential Equations

* Probability and Stochastic Processes
* Econometrics
* Business Analytics 
 * Managerial statistical tools in descriptive analytics and predictive analytics, including regression. Other topics covered include forecasting, risk analysis, simulation, data mining, and decision analysis

**What I'm unsure of (going to include descriptions for every one here)**

* Vector analysis 
 * Differential and integral calculus of vector fields. Topics include vector fields, total derivative of a vector field, Taylor series, linearization, curl and divergence, flows and the transport theorem, line and surface integrals, Gauss' and Stokes' theorems, differential forms, Navier-Stokes equations, applications to fluid flows
* Matrix analysis
 * Exponential matrices, unitary and positive-definite matrices, QR, polar, and singular value decompositions, matrix norms, perturbation methods for eigenvalues, numerical methods for matrix equations (with error analysis), weighted least squares, Kalman filtering, introduction to Hilbert space
* Analysis I and II
 * Rigorous development of the key concepts and theorems of differential calculus. Topics include sequences, series, limits, continuity, differentiability, properties of derivatives, and uniform notions of convergence and continuity
 * Rigorous development of the key concepts and theorems of integral calculus. Topics include the Riemann integral and its properties, a restatement of the key concepts of real analysis in the context of metric spaces and function spaces, and an introduction to measure theory and the Lebesgue integral

My apologies if this is an inappropriate post for this sub, but I couldn't find anything in the sidebar that indicated if it is or not.

I'm studying for an upcoming exam, and am stuck on what I believe is a fairly straight-forward problem:
>An apartment rental offers tenants the opportunity to ‘pay up front,’ in which case tenants may pay 
a lump sum of $20,000 immediately (with no additional payments) for a 2-year lease. If the lump 
sum payment was made January 1, 2014 for lease spanning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 
2015, what is the equivalent annual cost in terms of payments on January 1, 2014 and January 1, 
2015? Assume a 10% discount rate if necessary, and round to the nearest dollar. 
>
a) $10,000 
>
b) $12,100 
>
**c) $10,476** *(Correct Answer)*
>
d) $7,129 
>
e) None of the above 



This is where I'm at:

EAC = NPV / Σ [ 1/(1+R)^N ]

EAC = 20,000 / 1/(1+0.10)^2

EAC = 20,000 / 1/1.21

EAC = 20,000 / 0.826446281

EAC = 24,200

Now, even if I divide that by two (which I don't believe is the correct method) I get 12,100.  I have a feeling I'm missing an obvious step (either in applying the given information, or from my mediocre algebra skills).

0,1363646211.0,"This was a very thought provoking book that left me with a new perspective on financial markets, however the style that it is written in lets it down greatly. 

Firstly a little bit of background, Mandelbrot is a mathematician famous for developing the theory of fractals. This involves methods of describing irregular shapes mathematically, such as coastlines and abstract theoretical shapes. A core feature of fractals is that you can zoom in on them and they appear 'self-similar', for example imagine river networks where the main river has tributaries which in turn have smaller tributaries which themselves have smaller tributaries (and so on...). What he attempts to do in this book is apply this theory to financial markets. 

In the book Mandlesbrot sets out to portray two key points; that price charts are self similar and that prices don't vary in the conventionally assumed random manner.

The price charts point is fairly obvious to anyone who has been following financial markets for any reasonable length of time. Take away the time axis of a chart and you could really be looking at any time period. It is the second point that made me think and that led me to write this review, hoping to spark a discussion about it. 

What Mandlebrot basically says is that the widely held view that price varies randomly on a trade-by-trade basis is incorrect. If this did happen then a 5% fall in price today should have no effect on how the price changes tomorrow. What actually happens is that volatility clusters so when there is a big shock on any given day then the following days are more likely to experience price changes of that magnitude (direction isn't quite so predictable unfortunately). This again may seem fairly obvious to people following the market but theoretical models such as Black-Scholes and CAPM use the concept that price follows this random motion. If the stocks actually followed a gaussian distribution then the price should not vary as much as it does in real life. This gives us undervalued expectations of risk. 

In the book he suggests that price changes actually follow a power law. This results in the fact that a big change in price one day leads to a higher probability of a big change the next day as well. He states that different stocks obey power laws controlled by different powers. This means that some do move seemingly randomly in a gaussian distribution but others move much more wildly. It also means that if you were to try to predict a more wildly stock using a traditional method that you are likely to get caught out by large shocks. 

What do others here think of this? Is there a reason why incorrect theories are still so widely used? Does anyone work in finance and use his theories in a professional environment?

What I did not like about the book was the style Mandlebrot wrote it in. It come across that he is very bitter that few of his ideas really took off. He writes as though he is much smarter than you (which he obviously is) but that he is scolding you for having got it wrong for so many years. 

Overall I would recommend this book for someone interested in finance and maths however I would warn you that it is quite tough to finish. You pretty quickly get the jist of the book and then it is just endless examples of why he is right and everyone else is wrong.

**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 9.05am  
Announcement – New strategic focus for All Options**
  
  
Dear Colleagues,
  
We are in the midst of a market that has changed significantly. As many of you know, market making, our core business model, is dependent upon volume, and volume has died out in many of our markets. Today we see an environment where technology is critical, where the volumes in the underlying stock markets are declining, where investors seek safe and secure investments, where trading is being centralized into larger blocks of trade and dark pools, or going off-exchange completely. In addition, no one can predict when the markets will recover, if at all. This is not the market conditions the company was designed for in its current form. We as a company must change, we need to have a strong focus on what we are good at. Market making as we experienced it is dying out and we need to evolve. We are a trading company – and we need to focus on how we can get that profitable trading business back. 
  
What we intend to do is move away from primary market making obligations that lose us money, to focusing on sophisticated proprietary trading strategies in markets where we can gain real value, stopping loss making markets, reducing our traded-products portfolio, simplifying our infrastructure, and investing in dedicated technology.
  
With deep sadness I need to tell you that one of the unfortunate ramifications for this new strategy is that today we have to tell you that we will be closing our office in Hong Kong. The target date for closure of the HK office will be 1st January, 2011. I thank the team there for all of their efforts and hard work. We will however remain present in one of the Asian markets with our development of technology for Korea.
  
We also preparing to implement the new strategy in our Willemstad and Zug offices, with the international Managing Directors being informed this morning. In addition, I will personally be informing all of the Amsterdam employees more about the changes in a town-hall meeting at 13:00 today, in the Mercury Hall / Mercurius zaal at BP5. Please can everyone attend.
   
We need to embrace change and truly make the very best of it, we cannot dwell in the past and need to create a new winning team spirit and focus. Only then we can survive in today’s environment.
   
With best regards,  
Allard W. Jakobs  
On behalf of the Board of Directors  
     
**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 15.07pm   
Announcement – Further update on new strategic focus**
  
  
Dear Colleagues
   
I would like to outline more details to the intended new strategic focus for the company, which I also announced earlier today in person to the Amsterdam staff.
 
As a company that relied primarily on market making we were operating in market conditions unlike anything encountered in the last ten years. In many of our derivatives markets volume has dropped significantly, volatilities are flat, margins thin and investors are seeking other routes for their investments. What this means is that we were losing money in positions that we were obliged to take as a primary market maker.
 
In these new times, we need to change, to evolve our trading approach to take advantage of our position in markets where we can build stable revenues. What I intend to do, and which is now being reviewed by the Amsterdam Works Council, is a new focus for our company.
 
The aim of this strategy is to increase revenues by putting more focus on profitable markets, to align current cost levels with our lower revenues, and to re-establish the balance between our IT and business support group size in line with Trading.
 
To implement this strategy there will be three functional areas in the company: Trading, IT and Business Support.

The key developments in Trading will be:

* Simplify our trading infrastructure – have one office in Amsterdam, one clearing house, and one trading platform

* We intend to stop trading on loss making markets and focus only on those markets where Trading believe profitable trades are possible and are supported by ScreenTrader

* Closure of the Hong Kong office

* Simplify our product portfolio – reduce it from the 350 traded products we have now

* We intend to stop bidding for PMM memberships in unprofitable markets

* To reduce loss making broker flow by focusing on trades that generate value for the company

* We intend to stop all other loss making or marginal trading activities including ceasing with algo trading and 
energy trading

* Maintaining a small trading strategy group to do fundamental trading research: instrumental in developing new proprietary trading strategies

* Maintain our dedication on continual professional development for all traders
   
For IT the key developments are:
   
* Make IT Services one integrated team

* Continue to invest in the V2 trading platform with renewed focus on the markets we believe we can gain value from

* Relaunch AtomPro for all of our IT activities with a strong focus on the development of new technology


For business support, the proposed changes are intended to better realign the various support functions to more adequately match the size and scope of our intended new trading operations. Several departments will see staff reductions and we will integrate all of the Amsterdam staff into one building.
   
I do understand that this proposed new structure is a big change and you will all no doubt have many questions and concerns.
 
As I stated in my live presentation, I am ready and willing to take any questions you have, but recommend that you first talk to your department manager.
 
These changes are necessary for the company to continue to be a challenger in the markets. Only then can we survive in today’s environment.
 
With best regards

0,1429111877.0,"Morgan Stanley is nearing a deal to sell its oil-trading and storage business, potentially bringing to a close the bank’s lengthy effort to jettison the unit.

Trading firm Castleton Commodities International LLC has emerged as the leading bidder and is offering more than $1 billion for the business, according to people familiar with the situation. Castleton’s backers include hedge-fund heavyweights Glenn Dubin and Paul Tudor Jones.

Morgan Stanley and Castleton are still in discussions, and any deal—if one is struck—is still weeks away. The New York bank has attempted twice before to unload the business, first in 2012, when it couldn’t agree on terms with Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund, and then in 2014, when an agreement with Russian oil company Rosneft OAO unraveled amid tensions over Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.

Wall Street banks are shedding their physical-commodity operations amid a slump in raw-materials prices and pressure from regulators and politicians. The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns that the dangers associated with producing and transporting commodities pose a systemic risk to the financial system.

Officials say incidents such as the BP PLC Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico could saddle banks active in the sector with destabilizing liabilities.

Taking the place of big banks are privately held commodity-trading firms that operate across borders and face less regulatory scrutiny and lighter disclosure requirements. A sale to Castleton would reinforce this trend.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has told the bank’s board that selling the oil business remains a priority for 2015, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal is an important part of his strategy to shrink the portion of the firm’s balance sheet tied to debt, currency and commodities trading to less than $180 billion by year-end.

The issue has been a key focus during quarterly earnings conference calls with analysts. Morgan Stanley reports first-quarter results Monday.

The bank has remained active in physical commodities trading during the sale process. This year, the bank has leased almost two dozen tankers to haul more than a million barrels of refined-fuel products around the world, with the U.S. Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast frequent destinations, according to records available from data provider Reuters.

Morgan Stanley also has been supplying gasoline-blending components to Northeastern U.S. facilities operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Motiva Enterprises LLC, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company.

Castleton, based in Stamford, Conn., evolved from a spinoff of Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group’s energy-trading business several years ago.

Its owners include Mr. Dubin, a co-founder of $30 billion asset manager Highbridge Capital Management, which was later sold to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Mr. Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corp. Castleton’s chief executive is William C. Reed II, onetime head of power trading at Enron Corp.

Castleton’s bid topped that of the other contenders for Morgan Stanley’s unit, including Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd. and private-equity giant KKR Inc., according to people familiar with the talks.

Castleton and KKR had previously submitted a joint bid for J.P. Morgan’s physical-commodity assets when they were on the block in 2013. That business was ultimately sold to Swiss trading house Mercuria Energy Trading Inc. Castleton and KKR bid separately this time.

J.P. Morgan sold its physical-commodities business last year, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. divested a chain of metals warehouses in December. The Fed is preparing tighter restrictions on banks that trade commodities.

The value of physical assets would constitute much of the sale price. Those assets include barrels of oil and fuel, leases for pipeline capacity and storage terminals, supply and marketing agreements with oil companies and a 49% stake in a company that operates pools of tanker ships, Heidmar Holdings LLC. Those values could fluctuate in line with market prices.

The bank had $1.6 billion in tradable assets such as crude oil at the end of 2014, according to its most recent holding report filed with the Fed.

The other part of the price would be a premium, or the value assigned to the trading franchise Morgan Stanley has established in the oil market. The bank has been seeking premiums in the range of $300 million to $400 million, but the offers have come in the $200 million-to-$300 million range, according to people familiar with the talks.",KEY

0,1333011431.0,"I'm about to graduate in three months and like the rest of us, I need to find a job. The thing is, I don't want to work a salary job in an office all day working 9-5 slaving away, making the same amount of money as the person sitting next to me if I work harder. So therefore I'm thinking about looking into COMMISSION BASED JOBS.

I'm a hard worker, pretty good with people, good at math, and I'd like to think I'm a pretty good looking, smart, and savvy guy. I also believe that I am very good at reading people.

I've interned at a big financial advisory firm before, it seemed like it was something I wanted to do, but cold calling was a major turn off. But one thing I did really love about it was how my boss, a successful financial adviser, really cared about his clients and how he could have an endless potential money theoretically ( and realistically if he really did score big clients and such). If cold calling wasn't apart of it, I would 100% without hesitation do it. I just don't really believe in cold calling, and I know networking and knowing the right people is key to commission based jobs. I, of course, as a soon to be graduate from a normal loving family, do not have any big networks or list of rich people I can contact upon graduation.

So my question is - what kind of commission based jobs in finance are the best/ most fulfilling? I am willing to learn, work hard, and be the best what I will be. Financial adviser? Stock broker? Real estate agent lol?

TL;DR - bout to graduate, don't know what i wanna do for a career, but i know i want to do something related to finance. I don't want to work a salary job, would rather work commission based jobs due to the high potential of making money and becoming the best at it with hard work and constantly acquiring knowledge. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

0,1435361471.0,"Hey guys,
I'm looking into LKQ and have confusion on a short-thesis I was reading. My confusion is with a cash-degenerative roll-up. Here is a copy/paste of where I'm stuck:

The roll-up strategy inherently flatters earnings and CFO metrics. Roll-ups usually show both strong earnings and strong CFO (i.e.,

high earnings quality) due to the inherent financial statement mechanics of paying for growth through acquisition outflows (which 

do not affect earnings or CFO). Cash spent to acquire businesses runs through the Investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows, 

so the acquirer is able to inherit a new CFO stream without any CFO outlay (i.e. working capital investment). Moreover, as the 

acquirer liquidates the working capital of the acquired company in the normal course of business – collecting on receivables or 

selling inventory – it can realize an unsustainable CFO boost that has virtually nothing to do with the performance of its business. 

 As such, free cash flow after acquisitions is a key metric for analyzing roll-ups, presenting a better picture of the business’s 

economics. In LKQ’s case, it demonstrates that LKQ is an ineffective, consistently cash-degenerative roll-up. LKQ’s free cash flow 

after acquisitions has been negative in 8 of 9 years from 2004-2012, and is negative in the last twelve month period through 

September 30, 2013, a cautionary sign that its strong, positive CFO is not what it appears


What I'm confused about is the after acquisition free cash flow. Wouldn't the initial investment of the acquisition go onto the statement? What is the after acquisition free cash flow? How would this affect the statement differently?

They say they are subtracting the money that was out laid for the acquisition from the reported cash flow to arrive at their adjusted cash flow, but wouldn't the companies actual reported cash flow already have subtracted the money paid for the acquisitions?

0,1345799044.0,"http://micronassociatesfinance.info/blog/micron-associates-requires-a-good-deposit-and-not-just-a-good-credit-rating-in-getting-mortgage-after-debt-management/#.UDcYC8HibEG

If you are keen to buy a new home after you have resolved a debt problem with debt management, saving for a good deposit is just as important as a good credit rating.
According to Micron Associates Finance Daily Mail borrowers with deposits of five or ten per cent of a property’s value can find themselves paying more than double the mortgage interest of those with 30 to 40 per cent equity in the property.
A homebuyer with a 40 per cent deposit who needs to borrow £150,000 will pay about £300 a month less than a customer borrowing the same sum but pushing their ‘loan to value’ to the maximum 95 per cent.
For this reason if you have just finished paying your debts using a debt management plan (DMP) or individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) and are looking to get a mortgage the state of your credit rating is important. However your ability to stump up a significant deposit will also dramatically improve your chances of getting a mortgage.
Choosing a debt solution which will allow you to get out of debt in the fastest possible time should be a key criterion for those looking to buy a house in the future. Once they are debt free it may take a few years to save the necessary deposit by which time their credit rating will have improved dramatically.
The recent announcement of the government’s new funding for lending scheme should mean that banks can gain access to cheaper funds which in turn they can more readily lend out. But they are likely to be prepared to do this only to their customers who can offer large deposits.
Furthermore, a 95 per cent mortgage requires about one fifth more capital placed into reserves than an 80 per cent loan of the same size. Put another way, a firm can make six loans to those with a 20 per cent deposit for every five loans to those with a five per cent deposit.
The need for good deposit is therefore a key criterion when considering whether to apply for a mortgage. But according to the latest national housing survey published by the government only one in four would-be buyers who considered applying for a mortgage actually do so. The rest give up because they do not think they had a big enough deposit.
Thinking about the future and about the prospects of being able to get onto the housing ladder are often key criteria used by those who are trying to choose a debt solution. Many people may choose a solution which is not right for them because they wrongly believe that it will cause the least damage to their credit rating and give them the maximum opportunity to buy a house in the future.

However it is becoming increasingly clear that being able to put down a good deposit is just as important as the state of your credit rating when trying to buy a house, Micron Associates read.
The sooner you are debt free, the sooner you will be able to start saving for the all-important deposit which will in turn make it much easier for you to get a mortgage.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation#Subprime_mortgage_boom

It says that the CDOs, despite being comprised of poorly rated MBSs were given ratings just as high as MBSs that were sound ""on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so 'uncorrelated'"". 

This means that, if you use the diagram to picture the process, the houses that default on the loans are located in highly varied areas of the country and thus are unlikely to all fail to provide a flow of cash at once, right? But if they did somehow all fail, then the investment would essentially stop yielding returns and thus be a failed investment, as a large part of it would be repossessed by banks. Right? 

It says, ""CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course."" I read the page of the FCIC report cited here but still don't really understand ... does this mean that in good times, debt that acts as your capital base is repaid more often and thus you acquire / are able to use more leverage to invest, whereas if the market reverses course, your capital base isn't being replenished by debt payments and thus you can't invest?

And if we imagine a particular situation that might act as an example of this, does that mean that if someone wants to take a second mortgage on their house, the financial institution that would usually do it would say ""yeah I can give you that second mortgage, after all, I've got capital which I can use as a base to leverage and give loans."" But then when a large number of these loans fail, the over-leveraged institutions don't have that capital any more and thus can't or won't give loans, at which point the market begins to shrink and the debt built on debt built on debt built on bad loans freezes the financial system up, because the CDOs are packaged into other investments which are held by banks and they're going bad so banks can't lend because a lack of capital base?

0,1426819799.0,"Hey /r/finance. If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

I’m heading off to get my MBA in the fall and wanted to get r/finance’s opinion on Mac vs. PC when it comes to financial modeling. A quick search on the sub shows that PC wins hands down when it comes to short cuts, though the posts were all a year ago (so I think before Excel 2016). I’m nowhere near a pro with excel, but my entire career has revolved around it so I’m definitely above average.

Would love to get everyone’s insight (especially if you've used Excel 2016). A couple main concerns I have:

1) Is there an equivalent for the “alt” key in Excel 2016? Concerned for shortcuts like alt+n+n (insert line chart), alt+n+v+t (pivot table), etc.


2) Is there a short cut for right click? Not sure what the button is called in PC, but shortcuts like “right click button”+f+f (formatting), “right click button”+s (paste special), etc.


3) Can you toggle between worksheets using control+page up/down?


4) If OS X doesn’t allow for any of the above, would I be able to do 99% of windows shortcuts through a parallel?


5) Any other concerns I should have?

To be honest, I would love to get a Mac (screens are beautiful, and a goal of mine is to learn how to code iPhone apps), but I definitely don’t want to sacrifice excel functionality as I’m likely recruiting for jobs that will heavily use it.

Thanks for the help!

I'm interested in quantitative finance, and my university offers quite a bit of math that I can see being applied to quant fields. They have a really good finance program, but it doesn't involve that much high-level math (aka it's just business calc).

Having looked at grad programs in quant finance, they seem to involve a lot of stochastic calculus, numerical analysis, and time series stuff.

So what I'm interested in knowing is pretty much which of the classes from the bottom list would be good to take. If it ends up being enough of them, I might as well turn that math minor into a dual major in finance and math so I don't incur excess credits.

**What I already know to take (descriptions given for non-clear ones)**

* Calculus I,II,III
* Mathematical Foundations 
 * Axiomatic systems and techniques of proof, in preparation for upper-level study in mathematics. Topics include: symbolic logic, boolean algebra, set theory, countable and uncountable sets, techniques of proof, functions and relations, mathematical induction, group axioms. Emphasis is on preparing the student to read and write mathematical proofs, and to work with abstract definition and axioms)
* Differential Equations
* Linear Algebra
* Probability and Statistics
* Probability and Stochastic Processes
* Econometrics
* Business Analytics 
 * Managerial statistical tools in descriptive analytics and predictive analytics, including regression. Other topics covered include forecasting, risk analysis, simulation, data mining, and decision analysis
* Regression Analysis
* Time Series Analysis

**What I'm unsure of (going to include descriptions for every one here)**

* Vector analysis 
 * Differential and integral calculus of vector fields. Topics include vector fields, total derivative of a vector field, Taylor series, linearization, curl and divergence, flows and the transport theorem, line and surface integrals, Gauss' and Stokes' theorems, differential forms, Navier-Stokes equations, applications to fluid flows
* Matrix analysis
 * Exponential matrices, unitary and positive-definite matrices, QR, polar, and singular value decompositions, matrix norms, perturbation methods for eigenvalues, numerical methods for matrix equations (with error analysis), weighted least squares, Kalman filtering, introduction to Hilbert space
* Analysis I and II
 * Rigorous development of the key concepts and theorems of differential calculus. Topics include sequences, series, limits, continuity, differentiability, properties of derivatives, and uniform notions of convergence and continuity
 * Rigorous development of the key concepts and theorems of integral calculus. Topics include the Riemann integral and its properties, a restatement of the key concepts of real analysis in the context of metric spaces and function spaces, and an introduction to measure theory and the Lebesgue integral
* Discrete Math
 * Symbolic logic and Boolean algebra, propositional and predicate calculus, sets, functions, and relations, enumeration and counting principles, introduction to graphs, trees, spanning trees, shortest path and matching algorithms, finite state automata, Turing machines
* Numerical Analysis
 * Basic concepts and methods of numerical approximation, with emphasis on error estimates and computer algorithms. Topics include numerical differentiation and integration, solution of initial value problems, interpolation and quadrature, numerical solution of algebraic and transcendental equations, systems of equations, finite differences, introduction to finite element methods

If anyone here familiar with the quant field could give some insight as to which classes would be useful, I'd really appreciate it. Also if there's a better place to ask this, on reddit or otherwise, that would be great to know. Thanks!",KEYS

My apologies if this is an inappropriate post for this sub, but I couldn't find anything in the sidebar that indicated if it is or not.

I'm studying for an upcoming exam, and am stuck on what I believe is a fairly straight-forward problem:
>An apartment rental offers tenants the opportunity to ‘pay up front,’ in which case tenants may pay 
a lump sum of $20,000 immediately (with no additional payments) for a 2-year lease. If the lump 
sum payment was made January 1, 2014 for lease spanning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 
2015, what is the equivalent annual cost in terms of payments on January 1, 2014 and January 1, 
2015? Assume a 10% discount rate if necessary, and round to the nearest dollar. 
>
a) $10,000 
>
b) $12,100 
>
**c) $10,476** *(Correct Answer)*
>
d) $7,129 
>
e) None of the above 



This is where I'm at:

EAC = NPV / Σ [ 1/(1+R)^N ]

EAC = 20,000 / 1/(1+0.10)^2

EAC = 20,000 / 1/1.21

EAC = 20,000 / 0.826446281

EAC = 24,200

Now, even if I divide that by two (which I don't believe is the correct method) I get 12,100.  I have a feeling I'm missing an obvious step (either in applying the given information, or from my mediocre algebra skills).

0,1363646211.0,"This was a very thought provoking book that left me with a new perspective on financial markets, however the style that it is written in lets it down greatly. 

Firstly a little bit of background, Mandelbrot is a mathematician famous for developing the theory of fractals. This involves methods of describing irregular shapes mathematically, such as coastlines and abstract theoretical shapes. A core feature of fractals is that you can zoom in on them and they appear 'self-similar', for example imagine river networks where the main river has tributaries which in turn have smaller tributaries which themselves have smaller tributaries (and so on...). What he attempts to do in this book is apply this theory to financial markets. 

In the book Mandlesbrot sets out to portray two key points; that price charts are self similar and that prices don't vary in the conventionally assumed random manner.

The price charts point is fairly obvious to anyone who has been following financial markets for any reasonable length of time. Take away the time axis of a chart and you could really be looking at any time period. It is the second point that made me think and that led me to write this review, hoping to spark a discussion about it. 

What Mandlebrot basically says is that the widely held view that price varies randomly on a trade-by-trade basis is incorrect. If this did happen then a 5% fall in price today should have no effect on how the price changes tomorrow. What actually happens is that volatility clusters so when there is a big shock on any given day then the following days are more likely to experience price changes of that magnitude (direction isn't quite so predictable unfortunately). This again may seem fairly obvious to people following the market but theoretical models such as Black-Scholes and CAPM use the concept that price follows this random motion. If the stocks actually followed a gaussian distribution then the price should not vary as much as it does in real life. This gives us undervalued expectations of risk. 

In the book he suggests that price changes actually follow a power law. This results in the fact that a big change in price one day leads to a higher probability of a big change the next day as well. He states that different stocks obey power laws controlled by different powers. This means that some do move seemingly randomly in a gaussian distribution but others move much more wildly. It also means that if you were to try to predict a more wildly stock using a traditional method that you are likely to get caught out by large shocks. 

What do others here think of this? Is there a reason why incorrect theories are still so widely used? Does anyone work in finance and use his theories in a professional environment?

What I did not like about the book was the style Mandlebrot wrote it in. It come across that he is very bitter that few of his ideas really took off. He writes as though he is much smarter than you (which he obviously is) but that he is scolding you for having got it wrong for so many years. 

Overall I would recommend this book for someone interested in finance and maths however I would warn you that it is quite tough to finish. You pretty quickly get the jist of the book and then it is just endless examples of why he is right and everyone else is wrong. 

Interesting nonetheless. Discuss...",KEYS

I get what I'm supposed to do, but I'm confused because the answer doesn't (to my understanding) match up with what the question details. Specifically, the part that states:

""If it waits a year, the project’s up-front cost at t = 1 will 
remain at $1,500, the subsequent cash flows will remain at $500 per year if the 
competitor’s product is rejected and $25 per year if the alternative product is approved. 
However, if NPC decides to wait, the subsequent cash flows will be received only for six 
years (t = 2 ... 7).""

The problem specifically states that if the company waits a year, and the competitors product is approved (a 25% chance,) they will still receive cash flows of $25/year, but for only 6 years. However, in the decision tree of the answer key, the delay branch has no investment under 25% and states that if the company waits, they'll only invest **if the outlook is good**

Why does it tell me they're still going to still receive cash flows for 6 years of $25 if they apparently aren't even going through with the investment? Why does it not tell me they'll forgo the investment if the competitor's product is accepted?

**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 9.05am  
Announcement – New strategic focus for All Options**
  
  
Dear Colleagues,
  
We are in the midst of a market that has changed significantly. As many of you know, market making, our core business model, is dependent upon volume, and volume has died out in many of our markets. Today we see an environment where technology is critical, where the volumes in the underlying stock markets are declining, where investors seek safe and secure investments, where trading is being centralized into larger blocks of trade and dark pools, or going off-exchange completely. In addition, no one can predict when the markets will recover, if at all. This is not the market conditions the company was designed for in its current form. We as a company must change, we need to have a strong focus on what we are good at. Market making as we experienced it is dying out and we need to evolve. We are a trading company – and we need to focus on how we can get that profitable trading business back. 
  
What we intend to do is move away from primary market making obligations that lose us money, to focusing on sophisticated proprietary trading strategies in markets where we can gain real value, stopping loss making markets, reducing our traded-products portfolio, simplifying our infrastructure, and investing in dedicated technology.
  
With deep sadness I need to tell you that one of the unfortunate ramifications for this new strategy is that today we have to tell you that we will be closing our office in Hong Kong. The target date for closure of the HK office will be 1st January, 2011. I thank the team there for all of their efforts and hard work. We will however remain present in one of the Asian markets with our development of technology for Korea.
  
We also preparing to implement the new strategy in our Willemstad and Zug offices, with the international Managing Directors being informed this morning. In addition, I will personally be informing all of the Amsterdam employees more about the changes in a town-hall meeting at 13:00 today, in the Mercury Hall / Mercurius zaal at BP5. Please can everyone attend.
   
We need to embrace change and truly make the very best of it, we cannot dwell in the past and need to create a new winning team spirit and focus. Only then we can survive in today’s environment.
   
With best regards,  
Allard W. Jakobs  
On behalf of the Board of Directors  
     
**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 15.07pm   
Announcement – Further update on new strategic focus**
  
  
Dear Colleagues
   
I would like to outline more details to the intended new strategic focus for the company, which I also announced earlier today in person to the Amsterdam staff.
 
As a company that relied primarily on market making we were operating in market conditions unlike anything encountered in the last ten years. In many of our derivatives markets volume has dropped significantly, volatilities are flat, margins thin and investors are seeking other routes for their investments. What this means is that we were losing money in positions that we were obliged to take as a primary market maker.
 
In these new times, we need to change, to evolve our trading approach to take advantage of our position in markets where we can build stable revenues. What I intend to do, and which is now being reviewed by the Amsterdam Works Council, is a new focus for our company.
 
The aim of this strategy is to increase revenues by putting more focus on profitable markets, to align current cost levels with our lower revenues, and to re-establish the balance between our IT and business support group size in line with Trading.
 
To implement this strategy there will be three functional areas in the company: Trading, IT and Business Support.

The key developments in Trading will be:

* Simplify our trading infrastructure – have one office in Amsterdam, one clearing house, and one trading platform

* We intend to stop trading on loss making markets and focus only on those markets where Trading believe profitable trades are possible and are supported by ScreenTrader

* Closure of the Hong Kong office

* Simplify our product portfolio – reduce it from the 350 traded products we have now

* We intend to stop bidding for PMM memberships in unprofitable markets

* To reduce loss making broker flow by focusing on trades that generate value for the company

* We intend to stop all other loss making or marginal trading activities including ceasing with algo trading and 
energy trading

* Maintaining a small trading strategy group to do fundamental trading research: instrumental in developing new proprietary trading strategies

* Maintain our dedication on continual professional development for all traders
   
For IT the key developments are:
   
* Make IT Services one integrated team

* Continue to invest in the V2 trading platform with renewed focus on the markets we believe we can gain value from

* Relaunch AtomPro for all of our IT activities with a strong focus on the development of new technology


For business support, the proposed changes are intended to better realign the various support functions to more adequately match the size and scope of our intended new trading operations. Several departments will see staff reductions and we will integrate all of the Amsterdam staff into one building.
   
I do understand that this proposed new structure is a big change and you will all no doubt have many questions and concerns.
 
As I stated in my live presentation, I am ready and willing to take any questions you have, but recommend that you first talk to your department manager.
 
These changes are necessary for the company to continue to be a challenger in the markets. Only then can we survive in today’s environment.
 
With best regards

0,1429111877.0,"Morgan Stanley is nearing a deal to sell its oil-trading and storage business, potentially bringing to a close the bank’s lengthy effort to jettison the unit.

Trading firm Castleton Commodities International LLC has emerged as the leading bidder and is offering more than $1 billion for the business, according to people familiar with the situation. Castleton’s backers include hedge-fund heavyweights Glenn Dubin and Paul Tudor Jones.

Morgan Stanley and Castleton are still in discussions, and any deal—if one is struck—is still weeks away. The New York bank has attempted twice before to unload the business, first in 2012, when it couldn’t agree on terms with Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund, and then in 2014, when an agreement with Russian oil company Rosneft OAO unraveled amid tensions over Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.

Wall Street banks are shedding their physical-commodity operations amid a slump in raw-materials prices and pressure from regulators and politicians. The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns that the dangers associated with producing and transporting commodities pose a systemic risk to the financial system.

Officials say incidents such as the BP PLC Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico could saddle banks active in the sector with destabilizing liabilities.

Taking the place of big banks are privately held commodity-trading firms that operate across borders and face less regulatory scrutiny and lighter disclosure requirements. A sale to Castleton would reinforce this trend.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has told the bank’s board that selling the oil business remains a priority for 2015, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal is an important part of his strategy to shrink the portion of the firm’s balance sheet tied to debt, currency and commodities trading to less than $180 billion by year-end.

The issue has been a key focus during quarterly earnings conference calls with analysts. Morgan Stanley reports first-quarter results Monday.

The bank has remained active in physical commodities trading during the sale process. This year, the bank has leased almost two dozen tankers to haul more than a million barrels of refined-fuel products around the world, with the U.S. Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast frequent destinations, according to records available from data provider Reuters.

Morgan Stanley also has been supplying gasoline-blending components to Northeastern U.S. facilities operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Motiva Enterprises LLC, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company.

Castleton, based in Stamford, Conn., evolved from a spinoff of Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group’s energy-trading business several years ago.

Its owners include Mr. Dubin, a co-founder of $30 billion asset manager Highbridge Capital Management, which was later sold to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Mr. Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corp. Castleton’s chief executive is William C. Reed II, onetime head of power trading at Enron Corp.

Castleton’s bid topped that of the other contenders for Morgan Stanley’s unit, including Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd. and private-equity giant KKR Inc., according to people familiar with the talks.

Castleton and KKR had previously submitted a joint bid for J.P. Morgan’s physical-commodity assets when they were on the block in 2013. That business was ultimately sold to Swiss trading house Mercuria Energy Trading Inc. Castleton and KKR bid separately this time.

J.P. Morgan sold its physical-commodities business last year, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. divested a chain of metals warehouses in December. The Fed is preparing tighter restrictions on banks that trade commodities.

The value of physical assets would constitute much of the sale price. Those assets include barrels of oil and fuel, leases for pipeline capacity and storage terminals, supply and marketing agreements with oil companies and a 49% stake in a company that operates pools of tanker ships, Heidmar Holdings LLC. Those values could fluctuate in line with market prices.

The bank had $1.6 billion in tradable assets such as crude oil at the end of 2014, according to its most recent holding report filed with the Fed.

The other part of the price would be a premium, or the value assigned to the trading franchise Morgan Stanley has established in the oil market. The bank has been seeking premiums in the range of $300 million to $400 million, but the offers have come in the $200 million-to-$300 million range, according to people familiar with the talks.",KEYS

0,1333011431.0,"I'm about to graduate in three months and like the rest of us, I need to find a job. The thing is, I don't want to work a salary job in an office all day working 9-5 slaving away, making the same amount of money as the person sitting next to me if I work harder. So therefore I'm thinking about looking into COMMISSION BASED JOBS.

I'm a hard worker, pretty good with people, good at math, and I'd like to think I'm a pretty good looking, smart, and savvy guy. I also believe that I am very good at reading people.

I've interned at a big financial advisory firm before, it seemed like it was something I wanted to do, but cold calling was a major turn off. But one thing I did really love about it was how my boss, a successful financial adviser, really cared about his clients and how he could have an endless potential money theoretically ( and realistically if he really did score big clients and such). If cold calling wasn't apart of it, I would 100% without hesitation do it. I just don't really believe in cold calling, and I know networking and knowing the right people is key to commission based jobs. I, of course, as a soon to be graduate from a normal loving family, do not have any big networks or list of rich people I can contact upon graduation.

So my question is - what kind of commission based jobs in finance are the best/ most fulfilling? I am willing to learn, work hard, and be the best what I will be. Financial adviser? Stock broker? Real estate agent lol?

TL;DR - bout to graduate, don't know what i wanna do for a career, but i know i want to do something related to finance. I don't want to work a salary job, would rather work commission based jobs due to the high potential of making money and becoming the best at it with hard work and constantly acquiring knowledge. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

0,1435361471.0,"Hey guys,
I'm looking into LKQ and have confusion on a short-thesis I was reading. My confusion is with a cash-degenerative roll-up. Here is a copy/paste of where I'm stuck:

The roll-up strategy inherently flatters earnings and CFO metrics. Roll-ups usually show both strong earnings and strong CFO (i.e.,

high earnings quality) due to the inherent financial statement mechanics of paying for growth through acquisition outflows (which 

do not affect earnings or CFO). Cash spent to acquire businesses runs through the Investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows, 

so the acquirer is able to inherit a new CFO stream without any CFO outlay (i.e. working capital investment). Moreover, as the 

acquirer liquidates the working capital of the acquired company in the normal course of business – collecting on receivables or 

selling inventory – it can realize an unsustainable CFO boost that has virtually nothing to do with the performance of its business. 

 As such, free cash flow after acquisitions is a key metric for analyzing roll-ups, presenting a better picture of the business’s 

economics. In LKQ’s case, it demonstrates that LKQ is an ineffective, consistently cash-degenerative roll-up. LKQ’s free cash flow 

after acquisitions has been negative in 8 of 9 years from 2004-2012, and is negative in the last twelve month period through 

September 30, 2013, a cautionary sign that its strong, positive CFO is not what it appears


What I'm confused about is the after acquisition free cash flow. Wouldn't the initial investment of the acquisition go onto the statement? What is the after acquisition free cash flow? How would this affect the statement differently?

They say they are subtracting the money that was out laid for the acquisition from the reported cash flow to arrive at their adjusted cash flow, but wouldn't the companies actual reported cash flow already have subtracted the money paid for the acquisitions?

If you are keen to buy a new home after you have resolved a debt problem with debt management, saving for a good deposit is just as important as a good credit rating.
According to Micron Associates Finance Daily Mail borrowers with deposits of five or ten per cent of a property’s value can find themselves paying more than double the mortgage interest of those with 30 to 40 per cent equity in the property.
A homebuyer with a 40 per cent deposit who needs to borrow £150,000 will pay about £300 a month less than a customer borrowing the same sum but pushing their ‘loan to value’ to the maximum 95 per cent.
For this reason if you have just finished paying your debts using a debt management plan (DMP) or individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) and are looking to get a mortgage the state of your credit rating is important. However your ability to stump up a significant deposit will also dramatically improve your chances of getting a mortgage.
Choosing a debt solution which will allow you to get out of debt in the fastest possible time should be a key criterion for those looking to buy a house in the future. Once they are debt free it may take a few years to save the necessary deposit by which time their credit rating will have improved dramatically.
The recent announcement of the government’s new funding for lending scheme should mean that banks can gain access to cheaper funds which in turn they can more readily lend out. But they are likely to be prepared to do this only to their customers who can offer large deposits.
Furthermore, a 95 per cent mortgage requires about one fifth more capital placed into reserves than an 80 per cent loan of the same size. Put another way, a firm can make six loans to those with a 20 per cent deposit for every five loans to those with a five per cent deposit.
The need for good deposit is therefore a key criterion when considering whether to apply for a mortgage. But according to the latest national housing survey published by the government only one in four would-be buyers who considered applying for a mortgage actually do so. The rest give up because they do not think they had a big enough deposit.
Thinking about the future and about the prospects of being able to get onto the housing ladder are often key criteria used by those who are trying to choose a debt solution. Many people may choose a solution which is not right for them because they wrongly believe that it will cause the least damage to their credit rating and give them the maximum opportunity to buy a house in the future.

However it is becoming increasingly clear that being able to put down a good deposit is just as important as the state of your credit rating when trying to buy a house, Micron Associates read.
The sooner you are debt free, the sooner you will be able to start saving for the all-important deposit which will in turn make it much easier for you to get a mortgage.

0,1383750644.0,"This simple graph below show why stocks tend to be a sucker's bet

http://i.imgur.com/W2GNKZD.gif

What does it mean? Let us assume a hypothetical stock has risen from 10 to 11 units (could be dollars, cents, whatever) in a strait line in some time frame '1' unit (could be one year, one day, one month etc). There is also one unit of volume. (could be 100 shares, 10 million, etc).

On the RHS adjoining this line, let's assume the stock were to fall. What percentage of the original one unit of volume would be needed for the stock to fall back to 10? On the graph, the x axis is the percentage of the original volume. The y axis is the duration of time on the RHS relative to the LHS. So if the RHS is 1/10 the time duration of the LHS, you would have y=10. What this means is the quicker shares are sold the more rapidity stocks fall, but also less volume is needed and this obeys a non-linear relationship. ( this is due the annihilation process between buy and sell orders. the proof is omitted in this summary)

 That is why it's not all that uncommon for a stock to rise from $50 to $100 over many months and then fall back to $50 in just a week or less. The integral of the volume on the LHS is much greater than the RHS but the density of selling on the RHS is much greater and due to the non-linear relationship much less volume is needed.

But as y goes to infinity the expression converges to a >0 value. This is why a heavily traded stock will not fall 10% if you instantly sell 1000 shares.

This can work both ways, but more volatility tends to be bad for stock returns. For example if you start with $100, remove 10%, add 10%..etc you will have $0 after enough iterations 
It's for this reason I only buy very large cap stocks. or more specifically sell long term puts or use covered calls on large caps. you get a 10-20% return even if the stock is unchanged",LH

When I get the volatilities from VCUB in Bloomberg, to build the forward-forward vols to price the collar, should I use bid, mid or ask quotes?

0,1389532274.0,"Help me understand the fundementals -

I understand it to be a series of options structures chained together by maturity (i.e. 'fixing' monthly) where each single structure consists of:

* Investor is Long Call at the Strike which costs premium
* Investor is Short Put at the Strike which gains premium
* Investor is Short Call at the Strike which gains premium

Now, if its a 'leveraged' leveraged structure you would sell 2 puts and buy a further in the money call. (?)

The 'short call' leg is some kind of exotic option (up and out?) which somehow cancels the whole structure. (?)

What I also dont get is if you buy a non leveraged structure with no knock-out, how do the economics work? If you are only buying a call and selling a put at the same strike then its a cash negative position. (i.e. is it possible to have an accumulator with no knock-out?)

0,1427077555.0,"I've been trying to wrap my head around how options pricing works under non-normal return distributions and it's been pretty difficult to find any resources regarding this. I know pretty much no one in the market today assumes normally distributed returns when pricing options and I'm aware of the volatility surface/smile phenomenon. But it's not clear to me whether this phenomenon is the result of people using Black-Scholes and essentially just plugging in higher IVs at lower strikes according to some formula, or if people are just using completely different models now, which just happen to appear as a volatility smile when viewed through the lens of Black-Scholes. Is there an accepted standard here?

I guess what I'm looking for is someone to point me in the direction of some resources that either (a) expand on alternative models to Black-Scholes that don't assume normal returns (preferably models that are actually used in practice) or (b) explain how Black-Scholes is actually used in the real world without assuming the distribution of returns on the underlying is normal.

And in a similar vein, I would be really appreciative of any resources/research/papers exploring distributions that more accurately describe market returns compared to the normal distribution.

0,1429032737.0,"I have recently begun the HOLT/Credit Suisse Valuation Challenge and decided to browse through the Terms and Conditions section. A couple things stood out to me that sound rather troubling, but perhaps it's just my paranoia. 

Aside from the normal jargon that you would normally scroll through to the ""I Agree"" button, it seems Credit Suisse obtains quite a bit of information from participation in the challenge. I don't know the extent of its legality necessarily, and it isn't extremely troubling, but I thought I'd present it anyway:

>by participating in the HOLT Valuation Challenge the user grants Credit Suisse the right to provide Project Firefly with all the information and personal data submitted by the user. In addition, the user grants Project Firefly a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide and royalty-free right to use and publish all the information provided by Credit Suisse. 

I'm not too worried about a lot of the information I have submitted, so this is a rather moot point. But what it leads to is a bit more troubling. If you complete the challenge and gain access to the HOLT Lens software, there are some strict rules regarding its use that seem a little disingenuous for young investors like myself. 

>Students participating in this program are not customers of Credit Suisse and may use Credit Suisse tools solely for educational purposes. You may not use our tools for any other purpose, including for researching securities outside of your course of study, or for any personal investing. Credit Suisse is not liable for any losses related to your participation in this program, including losses related to the use of our tools in violation of any applicable license agreement.

What I'm worried about is HOLT/Credit Suisse impacting my future earnings from investments in the four years I would potentially have access to their software. Whether I use the software or not, it seems to me that any earnings are liable to these terms and conditions if I have access to the software. 

Any explanation is appreciated, and again this may just me being too paranoid about my investments.

0,1435361471.0,"Hey guys,
I'm looking into LKQ and have confusion on a short-thesis I was reading. My confusion is with a cash-degenerative roll-up. Here is a copy/paste of where I'm stuck:

The roll-up strategy inherently flatters earnings and CFO metrics. Roll-ups usually show both strong earnings and strong CFO (i.e.,

high earnings quality) due to the inherent financial statement mechanics of paying for growth through acquisition outflows (which 

do not affect earnings or CFO). Cash spent to acquire businesses runs through the Investing section of the Statement of Cash Flows, 

so the acquirer is able to inherit a new CFO stream without any CFO outlay (i.e. working capital investment). Moreover, as the 

acquirer liquidates the working capital of the acquired company in the normal course of business – collecting on receivables or 

selling inventory – it can realize an unsustainable CFO boost that has virtually nothing to do with the performance of its business. 

 As such, free cash flow after acquisitions is a key metric for analyzing roll-ups, presenting a better picture of the business’s 

economics. In LKQ’s case, it demonstrates that LKQ is an ineffective, consistently cash-degenerative roll-up. LKQ’s free cash flow 

after acquisitions has been negative in 8 of 9 years from 2004-2012, and is negative in the last twelve month period through 

September 30, 2013, a cautionary sign that its strong, positive CFO is not what it appears


What I'm confused about is the after acquisition free cash flow. Wouldn't the initial investment of the acquisition go onto the statement? What is the after acquisition free cash flow? How would this affect the statement differently?

They say they are subtracting the money that was out laid for the acquisition from the reported cash flow to arrive at their adjusted cash flow, but wouldn't the companies actual reported cash flow already have subtracted the money paid for the acquisitions?

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

>There is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned portfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or shouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-neutral portfolio? The answer is no. A dollar-neutral portfolio is self financing, meaning the cash you get from selling short pays for the purchase of the long securities, so the financing cost (due to the spread between the credit and debit interest rates) is small and can be neglected for many backtesting purposes. Meanwhile, the mar- gin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the risk-free rate rF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return minus the contribution from the credit interest) is R, and the risk- free rate is rF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe ratio is R + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free rate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to your stock positions.  

>Similarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does not hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the risk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess returns, since you do not have financing costs in this case, either. In general, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy returns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs financing cost.  

________

Edit: I emailed the author and he was kind enough to explain

>Sharpe ratio requires excess return as input. Excess return means raw return minus the funding (interest) cost. For e.g. if you have long $1M IBM, you need to pay interest on that $1M. (Another way to think of this is that your $1M cash could have been generating the same interest if you don't use it for buying IBM.) So the excess return of your $1M IBM is the raw return of IBM minus the interest cost. However, a dollar neutral position is self-financing: the cash earned from the short side is used to purchase the long side. Hence there is no funding cost, and there is no reason to deduct that in computing excess returns. You are generating returns out of thin air, and not incurring any real interest or opportunity cost in holding position. Anyway, with interest rate effectively 0 these days, such distinction hardly matters.

0,1447212433.0,"So I was reading some rates strategy outlook commentary and was totally lost. Here is what I read:

>We think the Fed is unlikely to wait very long to raise rates a 2nd time after their first rate hike in December, and will continue reinvestments throughout 2016, preventing a repricing higher of term premia.

> We recommend entering UST 5/30 flattener at 137 bp, targeting 110 bp, stop at 140 p; EDH6/EDH7 steepeners also recommended

So, a few questions.

I guess the phrase *will continue reinvestments* is referring to the Fed reinvesting the principal of their Treasury securities as they mature. One of their exit strategies is to, eventually, not roll them over, and instead take the money out of the money supply. But I guess they are saying they think they will instead keep reinvesting at least for now, thus not tapering as much as they could.

Ok, fine. But, what the heck does ""preventing a repricing higher of term premia"" mean???

And the rest of it, I guess they are somehow talking about the yield difference between 30 year UST and 5 year UST, but I don't get what they are saying about it. And I have no idea what EDH is.

I’m building a dcf model of mcdonalds and my terminal value is coming out waaaay too high. It’s almost 3x current market value. I’ve looked online for some comparable WACC calculations to see if I’m screwing anything up badly, and all the WACCs I’ve come across for MCD have been quite a bit higher. The problem is, they seem to be calculated improperly, using the wrong beta, way higher cost of debt, or different risk free rate. I’ll list my assumptions and maybe you can point out what’s out of wack with my wacc.

I’m currently using a beta of 0.5145 based on 1 year returns vs the S&P 500. I checked wolfram alpha and the 2 and 5 year betas are virtually identical at about 0.51, so I don’t think the beta is wrong. The risk free rate I am using in the capm model is the 10 year at 1.66%. The expected market return I am using is 6.45% from the quarterly CFO survey. Perhaps I should use implied expected return instead? For the cost of debt I am using the 2011 weighted average debt from the annual report which is 4.2%. These inputs result in 1.66 + 0.5145(6.45-1.66) or about 4.12% as a cost of equity. Given a 0.1354 debt/equity ratio and effective tax rate of 31.3% I end up with a WACC of 3.98% or so.

If I use the 30 year bond rate of 2.77 instead of the 10 yearI still get over 2x current market value for my DCF value. The WACC just seems very low. Lowering  my long-term growth rate expectations does lower the terminal value, but it still seems very high. If anyone can point out where I might have screwed up, please let me know.

0,1422847406.0,"I am trying to figure out a way to identify the leading contributors to the performance of multiple securities. For example, one idea I had was to run a multivariate regression using the securities returns as dependent variables and include things like oil, the dollar, the euro, treasury yields, etc.

E.g.,

SBUX + AAPL + MCD + BAC + TWTR = intercept + oil + dollar + euro + steel + gold + e

Would that be a correct way of seeing which variables are significant contributors to each of the stocks' performance?

Would Principal Component Analysis be a way of achieving the same end? A better way than multivariate regression? Is there another method suited to find these common contributors?

This was an idea floating around since the last time I posted here. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2621js/would_any_finance_professionals_in_nyc_like_to/).

I've met a lot of incredible professionals from this subreddit (and still have to meet one more!). Everyone I've met so far has been very smart, well versed in finance, easy to talk to, and just overall great people. 

I have already asked around and there is plenty of interest for a meetup, however I'm just curious to know how many more people would be interested in a reddit finance meetup?

I know how hectic everyones' schedule is, so this might not happen for another week, weeks, or in worst case scenario, month(s).

**Update**: So there is interest in the meetup but there are a lot of conflicting opinions. For one thing, many people have not posted when and where they are available making scheduling a headache trying to accommodate as many people as possible. Then there is the issue of trying to keep out certain... unwanted people *cough*, you know who I'm talking about.

0,1291337092.0,"Recent finance grad here looking for some input - How do I break into finance if I have no professional experience?

My situation:

I graduated in May with a Bachelor's in finance and have been looking for employment since. Like many of my peers, I did not succeed in finding an internship my junior year. Due to obvious market circumstances coupled with a foolish mentality at the time of not wanting to settle for a position with a company I didn't really want to work for, I ended up with no experience. I see now that any relevant experience would've been invaluable even if the company name did not build my resume itself.

What I have done in the last six months:

I have combed through postings on career sites (Monster, Careerbuilder, etc.) and corporate career pages with no luck. I have created profiles with all the major finance staffing/temp firms in my area, only to hear back from one which has yet to come up with any position that fits my profile. I have contacted alumni from my school and have been met with little useful advice and no leads. 

I am beginning to think that finding a job will be a pure stroke of luck and has nothing to do with working hard to get there. I am running out of ideas as well as optimism. I have confidence in my career potential, but can't find a way to develop it. 

Why I'm posting this here:

Maybe someone here knows something I don't or has a piece of advice that could be useful. Maybe you're looking for someone like me. Maybe you are someone like me and this will give you solace in the fact that you're not alone.

I am heading into my final year of a finance undergraduate at a mid-level research university. I have a 3.0 (result of the initial shock of being in college on my own).

0,1330471596.0,"I have been browsing this Reddit for quite some time and have found you all to be extremely open minded and helpful to those who are looking for advice. For this reason I wanted to create a post in hopes of finding some solid ideas. I'll provide a little background, and hopefully some of you will have been in the same situation before and can provide some help.

I graduated in December 2009 with a BSBA in Finance (UNCC) and had an internship with a local B/D who just merged with another B/D. I spent the first few months of my post-grad getting my Series 7 & 66 and Insurance licenses. I was under some scummy Insurance salesmen at first, but then was made an admin under a newly recruited advisor. The owners of the B/D could tell I was burning out b/c my ""superiors"" were pieces of shit and my ""leads"" were cold calls to small businesses in the midst of historically low business confidence. The rep I assist has a book which swings around $40mm on any given day, so I have gained a ton of experience assisting him with this (I help in all aspects of operations). We are ""captive"" reps for the time being because we get multiple expenses covered by our B/D and our office hasn't met it's potential due to two ""merger type events"" since March 2010. 

I have a small book of clients, but because of no marketing budget to draw from to generate leads, I have very little hope that I will see any significant growth any time soon. I have busted my ass building a website and general marketing materials using my prior graphic design experience, but all of that is caught up in compliance for the time being.

I was wondering how some of you other young advisors were able to gather a decent asset base with limited resources. I have a phone interview with Vanguard tomorrow, but after reading multiple reviews on GlassDoor, it seems their pay is shit and morale is pretty low. I want to stay an advisor because I truly enjoy interacting with others and helping them with their investments/life decisions. I work for an independent firm, btw, so I am not a victim of ""black & white"" options offered to reps of larger firms like Edward Jones or insurance based broker-dealers.

Http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/5400/why-is-the-fractional-reserve-banking-not-a-ponzi-scheme

**Update**
I would like to update this post to forewarn any newbs or other people with honest questions about financing principle's in general.

I came here to ""ask"" a question that very few of us in the United States fully comprehend, finance, ponzi schemes, etc.  Let's just play a mental excercise for a moment.  30% of the US are college graduates

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States ~25%

So... maybe 25% of the US population is ""educated"" enough to answer this question... but wait, there's more.

Out of that 25%, maybe only half of those (being generous here) have a business major to answer such a question.

So that pushes the # down to say 12.5%.

And out of that 12.5%, maybe some of those people DID TAKE THOSE CLASSES and still don't have a full grasp on the concepts involved.

Well... be careful if you post your question here.  Your ignorance will not be met with kindness.  Instead, your lack of knowledge can be met with hostility.

Cases in point:

> If you honestly think that verik's summary is insufficient, you cannot critically think about your opinions.

> You need to take an accounting course. Badly...

Yeah.  So this is a common trend apparently.  People are outright rude about the knowledge they have that other's don't and are willing to shame others to a point even if the original questioner has stated ""how am I wrong about my viewpoints/understanding of ponzi schemes/fractional reserve banking.""

so yeah.  Careful out there.  People can be... Less than polite... to those seeking to expand their knowledge.

I do take part in the blame.  I mainly was wondering if such a setup, ""was possible"" vs whether it was a ""ponzi scheme"".

**Original post**

I guess I should ask...

Why can't I use ""banks"" to create my own form of ""legalized"" risk reduced ponzi scheme?

Yeah, red flags all over the place for this post, but still...I was thinking about it.

Basically.  I go around, and I promise people a rate of return, **and actually provide it** by being allowed to ""lend the money out"" (x10 over) due to the fractional reserve system.

So I return the 110 (100% + 10%).  The rest of my *initial ""capitol"" which is $1000 due to the fractional reserve system* (x10 of your initial deposit), I lend out; or instead... **just buy govt securities that have a guaranteed rate of return**.

Why would something like that not work; or, how am I wrong about my viewpoints/understanding of ponzi schemes/fractional reserve banking.

I mean... If I can spend:

100$

and lend it out

So I promise my investor's 10%.

So I owe $110.

But... due to the FRACTIONAL RESERVE SYSTEM.

I can ""lend out"" up to x10 my initial investment.
**HERE'S THE KICKER, MY FREE CAPITAL:** I can use up to x10 of the 100$, so that's 1,000$!

So... if my investment is

$100.

And I need to pay back $10.



Can't I do something ""simple"" with the remaining 900$ of capital I have to work with (through lending is it?  Does buying govt securities count as ""lending""?) to guarantee a tremendous rate of return on my initial $100?",MET

I got the into the final round of interview. So sorry to whoever was removed from the list. 

Treat informal interviews like a formal interview. You cannot be over prepared for an interview. 

The interview went very well. I met him in his office. We talked for over an hour. He introduced me to the VP I would be working under if I accept the offer.

The main argument against inflation seemed to be that the Fed paying interest on excess reserves at the short-term market rate would stop the money multiplier effect, since there would no longer be an opportunity cost of holding excess reserves with the Fed.  [Per this Fed research article:](http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr380.pdf)

> When reserves earn interest, the multiplier process described above stops sooner. Instead of continuing to the point where the market interest rate is zero, the process will now stop when the market interest rate reaches the rate paid by the central bank on reserves. If the central bank pays interest on reserves at its target interest rate, as we assumed in our example above, the money multiplier completely disappears. In this case, banks never face an opportunity cost of holding reserves and, therefore, the multiplier process described above does not even start.

Do the banks have any restrictions absent capital and reserve requirements on what they can do with that reserve cash?  Once those requirements are met, which doesn't appear difficult seeing how they are flush with reserve cash, there seems to be a huge incentive for the banks to use as much of that reserve cash as possible to buy instruments that yield higher than the rate paid by the Fed on their excess reserves, as long as they continue meeting their new capital and reserve requirements along the way (and adjust for the added risk).  If I'm correct in that sub-conclusion, wouldn't that mean there is still an opportunity cost for some of those excess reserve holdings, which would explain the apparently unlimited demand for bonds?  Wouldn't this in turn incentivize companies (either through banks pressuring them or just leaping at too-good-to-be-true rates) to take on more and more debt at artificially low rates, giving them a lot of extra cash to spend in the economy?  And finally, wouldn't this be inflationary?",MET
0,1426106482.0,"So I am playing RH as a short due to inventory turns being higher than historically as well as versus their competitors, along with slowing Same-store-sales growth, lack of cash readily available for the increased capex cycle, and being the most levered furniture/home-goods retailer out there. I've been short since ~$90 and there hasn't been much movement yet. They've already announced that they met the high end of their guidance for 4Q14, but have yet to release more detailed financial statements for the quarter (ended January, usually they report at the end of March).

Now here's my issue: my thesis was slowing revenue growth and **rising inventory levels.** For those of you living under a rock there was a port work slow-down in CA that affected 29 ports across the state, and I found in the 10-K from last year that RH sources 70% of its product from China and that it's west coast furniture distribution center is located in CA.

What do you think, is my thesis shot because of this?  I could see constraints hitting the top-line guidance and also sending RH down, but I'm unsure if it's acceptable to alter my thesis because I may be trying to just to justify being short subconsciously.  ",MET

0,1306781458.0,"A large number of people took risky loans to speculate on rising home prices. The resulting boom then bust in house prices with associated defaults on mortgages is still rippling through the economy. There has been significant destruction in wealth and tax income. America has reacted by flooding frozen financial markets with quantitive easing, resulting in a fall of interest rates with a drop in the dollar and a rise of stocks and commodities. Due to massive unemployment, there is currently no wage inflation. In fact, individual cities and states are struggling to meet their financial obligations at a time when a resurgent republican party has rediscovered the merits of fiscal responsibility. S&P has indicated if might lower the credit rating of the USA Govt if debt significantly exceeds 100% GDP. So the Fed needs to cut back spending . If the Fed starts bailing cities and states out and prints money to pay for federal expenditures, then the dollar will fall and interest rates must rise. The result may cause wage inflation which could quickly spiral out of control. If the Fed, cities and states drastically cut back spending then we might see another recession and possible deflation. Any hint of deflation would likely be met with a war on deflation and the over correction could result in inflation in addition to a recession. Currently with short term rates at zero and the markets saturated with quantitive easing, the US Fed Reserve has no tools left to fight the next recession. The Fed is therefore nervous, and wants to raise rates before quantitive tightening.  All signs point to interest rates going up, and a fall in stocks and commodities.  If the US politicians do not raise the debt ceiling interesting things will happen, the dollar could plunge, interest rates could sky rocket, and investments may plunge. If the US currency stopped being the defacto currency of choice, then all bets are off.

The worst case scenario may not be likely however. Some european governments are currently unable to repay their debts. Due to a common currency, the governments cant simply inflate their way out of a debt crisis. All European governments must agree to the required inflation. Currently richer nations in the EEC are lending massive amounts of money to those nations that need it most. While the risk of inflation is probably priced into the US dollar, it may not be fully priced into the Euro yet. 

Currently China is struggling with its fixed rate currency. Domestic inflation is significant, and likely to continue until the Chinese float the Yuan. While it is difficult to predict what will happen in such a regulated country, if the Chinese economy enters a recession, it could plunge the world into another recession.

As a result, we could see inflation in America and Europe, with a fall in the Euro and a rise in the Yuan. Most western governments are  over leveraged. Interest rates must rise, worldwide inflation seems likely,  but this will result in falling stocks and bonds plus stumbling economies. The next recession could be a doozy, as there are not a lot of tools left in the economic tool boxes of the central banks around the world.

0,1405805351.0,"I'm starting a masters in market finance this fall and think I might have found a topic for a research and would like your input.

After reading up on Jim Simons and his methods (and especially his returns) I was curious about a way to quantify hype on certain stocks. 

Then I found the twitter sentiment app, a beautiful tool really. I found out about Paul Hawtin, a guy who operated his own ""twitter hedge fund"" in 2012. He met with a professor who had wrote a paper on predictions on the DOW from twitter sentiment analysis and found that there was in fact something.

Hawtin actually traded and still trades today (under his new Cayman Atlantic Ltd boutique investment management firm) using twitter, and while he uses it to predict the DOW, I would like to research if there was any impact concerning individual stocks.

While this is not a new subject at all, I had never heard of it and would like to know everything about it.

Would it be a good idea to switch from the ""course version"" of the masters to the research one to pursue such subjects? 

Would it give me an edge in the financial jobs market or should I just pursue the basic masters+CFA1 (I'm still gonna do the CFA1 though). 

tl;dr: Would it be wise career-wise to spend my masters in finance researching a way of making money using twitter on individual stocks?",MET

So basically, I am new to the world of finance. I've never been great with money, and I haven't worked anything more than a minimum wage job. However, now I am a new college grad and get paid very decently as a software developer.

Predictably, some of my old minimum wage habits have stuck with me. Still spend money on the bars/weed and other unnecessary, non asset building things, not saving as much as I should probably, living in a nice apartment in the city, you know the drill.

I discovered this sub-red and figured this would be as good a place as any to start breaking bad habits. For the year of 2014, I have a few goals.

1) Stop smoking, or at least cut back, to save money.
2) Move back with my parents, or to a more sensible apartment
3) Bump up the amount I save each month to $500 or more, instead of $250 where it is now
4) Track my bank account through an app I am developing. Debt incurred, expense tracking, etc... More of a learning opportunity to get better acquainted with my own finances than a serious attempt to develop an app, but I am writing the code regardless. 

Any other ideas? I would love to start learning the right financial habits while I am still relatively young, with minimal debt.

>The widespread denunciations of excessive banking industry pay are met with incredulity and outright hostility. It’s one thing to be angry over a reversal in fortune; it’s one of the five stages of grief. But the petulance, the narcissism, the lack of any sense of proportion reveals a deep-seated pathology at work.
 

>Although the word “entitlement” fits, it’s been used so frequently as to have become inadequate to capture the preening self-regard, the obliviousness to the damage that high-flying finance has inflicted on the real economy, the learned blindness to vital considerations in the pay equation.
 
 
>Exhaustion and loss of personal boundaries are an ideal setting for brainwashing, which is why people who have spent much of their career in finance have such difficulty understanding why their firm and their worldview might not be the center of the universe, why they might not be deserving of their outsized pay. The finance community has other elements in common with cults.
 

>The idea that the needs of the financial sector trump those of the productive sector isn’t just specious; as the crisis so vividly demonstrated, it’s outright dangerous. But its strange persistence as an article of faith among our leadership class, both in government and the media, has yielded inertia and fecklessness where there should be energy and resolve.

$150M of AAPL stocks. Here are my questions about this transactions. 

* Why couldn't AAPL allow the general public to buy $150M worth of 
non-voting shares, but instead he went to only one entity - MSFT - for 
this financial lifeline? This is pricing discrimination, because our 
price is $INFINITY and MSFT's price was $150M. 

* When MSFT bought $150M worth of AAPL shares in '97, did they buy 
from the secondary market or did they buy from a new offering? These 
shares were non-voting anyways. 

* Why didn't AAPL issue$150M worth of high-yielding bonds to MSFT? 
This would have had more stability, paid a higher-than-normal yield, 
would have been tax favorable to AAPL, and they are also a non-voting 
investment in MSFT. 

* How does a company ""issue shares towards prosperity""? This 
dilutes EPS and just doesn't make sense to me. This is what doesn't 
make sense specifically: If a distressed company issues $100M of 
shares, then that distressed company's new business model is to simply 
issue shares and some C-level executives (i.e. CEO, COO, etc.) and i- 
Bankers get rich. But the new shareholders lose value over time. Their 
investment in a distressed company is bad. How do you issue your way

(I have a Mac for personal use and I hear MS Office sucks on it, so whatever.)

Anyway, am I at a disadvantage here? I just hear so many horror stories about unpaid internships being the new ""entry level job."" It's ridiculous out there. How useful am I going to be?

I'm 19, and I don't know much about this industry, but did he really want me to stay in touch? He said ""This industry is all about the connections you make, and you just made your first one, stay in touch!"" ...How do I do that? I figure in a month or two I'll email him asking some question about the industry, and then a month or two after that I'll ask if he knows of any internships opening up around? I get that I have to stay relevant in this guys mind, but what's the best way to do so?

For anyone who read this the whole way through, thank you. Your help is well appreciated.

0,1408375748.0,"Hello all,

I have an accounting undergrad and will be pursuing my MS in Finance this next year. Afterwards, although I am not entirely sure where I want to work yet, I am looking forward to an intellectually stimulating and lucrative career.

However...

There is a lot, and I mean A LOT of negativity on the internet about the work-life balance in finance. A quick Google search turns up a number of financial professionals who have written about the horrors of regular 70-80+ hour work weeks, overly demanding bosses, and general unhappiness with their career paths.

Now, don't get me wrong, I know finance is tough and I am prepared to work hard. But still, at some point in my life I want a family and time to pursue hobbies. I simply refuse to let work consume my life. 

So, I suppose the question I am posing to those of you in the professional world is how do you make work-life balance work? Are finance jobs with 40-50 hour work weeks that uncommon?

Thank you ahead of time for your responses.

tl;dr: I will be entering the financial world soon, and there is a lot of negativity on the internet about work-life balance for these jobs. Is it really that bad?

EDIT: Thank you all for your informative responses. I really appreciate your willingness to provide me some insight into your careers.",MS

I work in a family office which flips fixed income. I have been trying for some time to understand how corporate bonds are priced and how to work out where fair value lies.

I consitently see MS+X coming up and I just can't find anyone who can explain to me in a simple way what exactly these mid swaps are referring to (I understand that mid swap is the mid point of bid-offer spread on a swap). How would I then go on to structure a judgement about whether to buy the bond?

0,1306969125.0,"I'm discovering an interest in both finance and statistics, but only after having gotten out into the workforce with a B.B.A. in MIS and an M.B.A.  I'm rather enjoying reading a book that I bought on ordinary differential equations and pestering a friend who's doing his Ph.D in stats about statistical concepts.  Unfortunately, there's only so far that I can take myself without formal instruction, as the mathematical literature is terse, to put it gently.  Does anyone know how I should go about getting the requisite knowledge, skills, and documentation for this?  

I'm thinking that I should probably go talk to the local university (Ohio State) and see if I can roll my own degree.  Of course at that point, do I do an MS or go for a Ph.D?  And would it be better to try to work it on the side along with a full-time job or just cut out entirely and go full-time student?  The idea of dropping out of the workforce for four to five years just does not sound appealing.

I know that I'd need to beef up on some computer science (2 years of PHP and some dabbling in Python, where I need to get heavy in C and C++) as well as really hit the math hard.

Any thoughts, r/finance?
Thanks!

Update:
Thank you all for your comments.  I think that what I'm going to do is settle into my new job, study up on my own some more, and then see if I can get my employer to pay for a few classes at a time while I truck my way through a Ph.D. preferably with a master's along the way, if I can get classes to double-up.  So long as I don't have to quit my day job, I'm in no particular hurry to complete this.  A number of the comments helped to clarify this path.  A number of others have given me quite a bit of self-study to work on.  Thanks!",MS
0,1332445860.0,"I am currently trying to write a two level monte carlo simulation to delta hedge a portfolio containing one call and one put. The simulation looks something like this:


for m=1; scenarios

    for n=1; simulations

        St = st*exp(drift+vsqrdt*randvar)

        delta = exp(-r*T)*(ST/S0)*sign(ST-X);

        Shold = ...

    end

portvalue = ...

end
mean(portvalue) = ...  stdev(portvalue) = ...

My problem lies within calculating the delta of the portfolio. I am trying to use the pathwise method presented by Glasserman(2003) but am having a little trouble understanding it. Do i need to add a third nested loop inside the inner one, where at each time step another set of simulations are run, under the condition of the current price, in order to calculated the delta from a distribution of paths, or can the delta at each time step be calculated using the single St path after the original simulation completes. Another way of asking it, do I need to stop at each time step and calculate the delta from a simulated distribution, or do I calculate the deltas after the simulation has complete and go back to update the holdings. I'm trying to make this as efficient as possible so I'm wondering if a third level of nesting can be avoided. I hope my questioning is clear enough, thanks for the help.

Edit: Sorry for the terrible framing of my question.  A little more simply stated, at each time step (represented by the inner loop), I need to calculate the delta of a portfolio containing one call and one put on the same underlying stock, with the same strike price, and rebalance the portfolio to be delta neutral, by purchasing the underlying stock.  For what I have researched, a pathwise estimation of delta presented by Glasserman is one of the most efficient ways to do this.  However, I am having trouble implementing it into my delta hedging program.  

Now for better sources on the pathwise delta estimation: 
I was not actually looking at Glasserman(2003) but references to it.
I found Glasserman reference it in 1996 [Here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Zrn_sTFMLh0J:www.columbia.edu/~mnb2/broadie/Assets/bg_ms_1996.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiiOkGhQc6J77zfUbRNdZqGTzwqCvsF-j6Cy4wIbZ35cCIwimurNv8CQDvVqd8Xaz_Izc-DaBn7EuLr9IKxKxo2ZCYpplKKrSUSr8D6WexH6esIr714tCT2nKkpo6KguAUFV3pG&sig=AHIEtbSxxz0ETx-0JJnUqVEg1zxHD0Njrw) on p. 270 under pathwise derivatives.
The main paper I am trying to follow is [Here](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~staum/sas.pdf) (Sun, Apley, Staum).  They start reviewing this method specifically in Section 5: Illustrative Example and Numerical Results, and the delta equation is on p.18.  It is also recreated [Here](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/NA-07-12.pdf) by Giles as the handed coded forward method in comparison to the reverse method.",MS
0,1440693689.0,"So ever since I was a little kid I have wanted to be involved in Investment Management. My Mother used to be an overnight fed funds broker, and moved something in the neighborhood of 6 Billion a week to various banks. This lead to us taking multiple trips to NYC as a kid, and when I fell in love with NYC. I visit NYC about three to four times a year, and a few of my Fraternity brothers live there now, but are not in the industry.  

I am currently finishing up my joint MBA/MS(Finance - Asset Management) (3.25 GPA), from a well ranked program. I plan on pursuing a CFA thereafter.  I have 5 years of Direct and Wholesaling experience under my belt for 401k record-keeping. I love the deals side of our business, so front office is where I feel I would fit best in. I am open to pursuing opportunities outside of the 401k side, and would like to focus more on the investments portion. I am 26 years old, and I feel as though it would be an ideal time to try to make this transition. I have read plenty of journals as far as what work might look like on a day to day basis. So I am not afraid to sacrifice social time, or work long hours, late nights.

But I am still very hazy on just how to get up there, and get my foot in the door. I am also trying to get a better idea of what income may look like. I have checked Glassdoor, but I feel that is still not a very good representation of what the take home is. As the AE's I support take some in the range of 500k and on the website they list them to take home 125k. Are recruiters worth checking into? Should I still to the large companies? How would one get a job in a smaller shop? I am open to being PM'd for further detail and more in-depth conversation.

I always assumed they were just an opinion based on public information. I rarely learn anything by reading them, though sometimes they manage to put the dots together in ways that I hadn't considered.

If that's the case, why does it matter if, for instance, MS or JPM issues a report ahead of FB's IPO saying that they have changed their outlook on future earnings?

0,1398016461.0,"Is there a formula or metrics I can look at that tests put call parity in an environment with transaction costs?  I know in practice, PCP usually does not hold when we consider transaction costs but is there a test for it?  

Context:  My school is doing a trading competition, they take a random 3 mo of stock prices and use black scholes to generate option prices.  They then +/- a random variable with mean 0 to stock & option prices to add noise and add/subtract another well behaved random variable to determine the bid-ask spread.  Transaction costs are fixed and are 0.015 or 0.025 of total transaction value depending on what it is (stock vs option, long vs short).  

My idea is that since there is a lot of random noise thrown into prices, if the random variables shift prices favorably enough, there could be an arbitrage opportunity but I haven't been able to figure out the best way to test this.  

What I've been doing so far with a set of test data my professor generated, is testing PCP with mid prices for two dates ie: 4/7/2014 and 4/11/2014.  If there is a spread in PCP and it converges within this range, I then run the trades  and unwind them factoring in transaction costs (bid/ask spread & transaction coefficients) to see if it is profitable overall.  Unfortunately, this doing/unwinding the trades is very time consuming and I have yet to automate it with vba code.  I was wondering if there is a metric I can look that can help me make this decision faster?  I was thinking maybe doing something that looks at the PCP spread without transaction costs and comparing it to the transaction costs as a % of the spread but I have not been able to figure out the math & logic behind this.

Hey everyone!

I am dipping out of Med School and going to field finance. Why? For several reasons. My family has always been in business, it's in my blood, the way I think and appraise property when I'm walking down a street in Manhattan. I have been always working on the side with them, so I highlighted that in my resume and back the science stuff in the back. But I feel, this has given me an opportunity to read complex scientific articles and extract only useful information, think critically, and solve unique problems. I feel my negotiating skills, charisma, among others will definitely be an asset to any firm I join but there a huge roadblock...

How do I get my foot in the door? 

**PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I'M THE WRONG TRACK, THANKS :)**

I am open and all entry-level positions and found out some pros and cons working with a big or small firm. Big firms have money for training program so I will have a strong foundation enforced by people who push me harder. Smaller firms will offer quicker upper mobility, more hands-on training and much more exposure in comparison to a bigger firm. 

But if I really want to work with a larger firm, but it's really hard to get in, by my understanding. I guess I'm asking how do I become an analyst? Do I need to work at a small firm first for 8-9 mo. then transfer to a larger firm? How do you know there is an opening in a other firm? 

**It's late and I'm going to pass out, super tired. I know there's ton of sp. mistakes and grammatical errors. I want to add more information and clean this up. But I hope someone can give me a push in the right direction! Thanks for listening**

**EDIT 1: Thank you everyone for getting back to me. Ok some obvious stuff, I forgot to mention. I majored in Biology and minored in Economics. Also, yes finance is an extremely broad topic. I would love to do a summer internship anywhere, somewhere I can get my feet wet and acquire a taste of varying topics. What I am specifically interested is in something along S&T (Sales and Trading). I am about a year deep in my education, but I do not foresee a future in this at least for me.** I hope this helps driving a stronger decision. I have read over and most of the consensus is suggesting just get into a good b-school and that should jumpstart my career, right? ",MOS

We recently received an executed commitment for a $26MM credit facility @ 40% stabilized loan to value over an 84 month term with IR floating @ 175 bps over 1 mo LIBOR.

A few questions below for those of you who live and breathe in the debt capital markets...   

1. What is the best way for me to analyze the effective cost of capital under each of the three scenarios?  

2. What methodology should I use to quantify total risk protection premium?   

3. How should the cost of the IR cap be built into the amortization table? Should the cost by amortized equally over the term, or applied to ""Month 0"" to solve for an NPV?

0,1307907262.0,"Right now I'm 23, and I have a 2040 Target Date Portfolio managed by Blackrock through my current employer. (2040 is the latest offered, my actual retirement year will be 2053)  However, I have not been impressed by the returns or how the portfolio is structured. For the first quarter in 2011 I got a 1.91% return. 

This is how the portfolio is structured right now:

* 0.0% Cash (Citigroup 3 Month T-Bill Index Fund)
* 1.3% Inflation-linked Bonds (TIPS - Lehman TIPS Index Fund)
* 13.3% Nominal Bonds (Lehman Aggregate Bond Index Fund)
* 7.4% Real Estate (REITs - FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index Fund) 
* 43.1% U.S. Large Cap Stocks (S&P 500 Index Fund)
* 9.9% U.S. Small and Mid Cap Stocks (DJ Wilshire 4500 Completion Index Fund) 
* 25.0% International Stocks (MSCI ACWI - Excluding US IMI Index^sm Fund)

Expense Ratio in 2010 was .58%. 

I think the portfolio is too heavily weighted to US Large Cap stocks and consequently I would like to restructure the portfolio to be this:

* 0.0% Cash (Citigroup 3 Month T-Bill Index Fund)
* 2% Inflation-linked Bonds (TIPS - Lehman TIPS Index Fund)
* 8% Nominal Bonds (Lehman Aggregate Bond Index Fund)
* 15% Real Estate (REITs - FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index Fund) 
* 30% U.S. Large Cap Stocks (S&P 500 Index Fund)
* 15% U.S. Small and Mid Cap Stocks (DJ Wilshire 4500 Completion Index Fund) 
* 30% International Stocks (MSCI ACWI - Excluding US IMI Index^sm Fund)

Changes I made: slightly increased the TIPS, reduced nominal bonds, doubled REIT, reduced US large caps, increased US small caps, and increased international stocks. 

So my question is this: To make these changes to my target date portfolio do I have to call up Blackrock or do I talk to the company that my employer has the 401k program though? Any help would be appreciated! ",MSCI

Let's be nice to NFLX and assume they can squeeze a little more money out of their sub base and let's push the revenue contribution per sub number from $94 each to $110 each puts us at revenue around 33b.

Market cap today is 78b, and NFLX ""might"" be able to hit 4b in NI in 13 years. So if the stock doesn't go up 1 penny from now until 2030 it'll be trading at a P/E of 19.

I am a college student that is investing using an online stock trading game (marketwatch). The game started in early November and my strategy so far has been to invest in companies that will have their earnings released within the next week, eventually selling a day or two after earnings have been released. I haven't invested in just any companies releasing earnings; I will invest in companies in which I have seen substantial growth over the quarter. For example, I have experienced incredible returns by investing in GPRO, NFLX, AVGO. etc. My portfolio value at day 1 was $1 million, and since then, I have made 85 trades and have returned 177% during the last few months (Portfolio value today = $2.7 million).

0,1479154760.0,"I think the next few years will bode well for mortgage REIT's like ORC as interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens. The steepening of the yield curve means that mortgage REITs will have more profit due to the arbitrage strategy they employ. 

This is the chart to keep an eye on: 

https://ycharts.com/indicators/302_year_swap_spread

Its the difference between the two year treasury yield and the thirty year treasury yield. 

For those who are unaware, in the third quarter of 2016 - ORC was able to make 85cents a share profit with the yield spread as low as .66% which is really phenomenal and speaks to how well managed their portfolio is.

The next few quarterly reports I think will show us how ORC will perform with the steepening of the yield curve.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",ORLY

0,1384476782.0,"*SPOILER ALERT - FYI* 

For those of you that have seen the movie, *Margin Call*, I am curious about just how real the 'fire sale' premise is. 

In the movie, the firm is able to liquidate a massive portion of their MBS/CDO/whatever else holdings in one trading day. Obviously there are some other problems baked into this scenario. One of which being, it is ridiculous to me to think that one analyst could 'figure out' some VaR models that indicate the party was over, before anyone else on the street had any idea there was something wrong. 

Another is, from my understanding, one of the problems with the securities these banks held was they were very illiquid. As such, is it even possible to trade one of these securities over the line in ~5 min? Or is there more detailed analysis that needs to take place that would increase the time necessary to complete each transaction?

TL;DR How plausible would it be that one firm could move this amount of MBS/CDOs in one day? If not at all, what would the process for this scenario look like? Does this firm just end up like Bear, Lehman, or Merrill in reality?",ORLY

But it's not clear to me whether this phenomenon is the result of people using Black-Scholes and essentially just plugging in higher IVs at lower strikes according to some formula, or if people are just using completely different models now, which just happen to appear as a volatility smile when viewed through the lens of Black-Scholes. Is there an accepted standard here?

I guess what I'm looking for is someone to point me in the direction of some resources that either (a) expand on alternative models to Black-Scholes that don't assume normal returns (preferably models that are actually used in practice) or (b) explain how Black-Scholes is actually used in the real world without assuming the distribution of returns on the underlying is normal.

>**Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to long-dated options.** We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that the Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty.

>We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is the accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be
accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an insurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black-Scholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of both their values and ours were the two[sic] far apart.

>Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that calculated by Black-Scholes, but we can’t come up with an exact figure – anymore than we can come up with a precise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t
bother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.

The ""absurd example"" is on [page 20 of the 2008 annual report [PDF]](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2008ar/2008ar.pdf)

>So let’s postulate that we sell a 100- year $1 billion put option on the S&P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied volatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and dividend assumptions, we would find the “proper” Black-Scholes premium for this contract to be $2.5 million.

>To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&P will be valued a century from now at less than today. Certainly the dollar will then be worth a small fraction of its present value (at only
2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher. Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of most of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about
175-fold, mainly because of this retained-earnings factor.


>Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year period to be far less than 1%. But let’s use that figure and also assume that the most likely decline – should one
occur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5 million ($1 billion X 1% X 50%).

>But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to invest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have been profit. Would you like to borrow money for 100 years at a 0.7% rate?
Let’s look at my example from a worst-case standpoint. Remember that 99% of the time we would pay nothing if my assumptions are correct. But even in the worst case among the remaining 1% of possibilities – that
is, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my assumptions are crazy or the formula is inappropriate.

>The ridiculous premium that Black-Scholes dictates in my extreme example is caused by the inclusion of volatility in the formula and by the fact that volatility is determined by how much stocks have moved around
in some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probabilityweighted range of values of American business 100 years from now. (Imagine, if you will, getting a quote every day on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing quotes as an important ingredient in an equation that predicts a probability-weighted range of values for the farm a century from now.)

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

The average investor believes the 2000 and 2008 and 2011 declines are/were temporary, and they are. But how temporary? It's been 12 years and we still are in decline if the dow is indexed in real US dollars. The dow only a few weeks ago was the same level it was in 2000, 2008, 2006, 2001, and 2010. A level which is measured in inflating dollars. Accounting for inflation we are at where we were in the early 90s and late 80s.

In recessions, as usual, investors realize they need to pull out into cash. More and more investors are realizing this is a lost decade or even a lost year or 4 years. They will want to step away for a few years. Then will quickly realize, or already knew, holding cash is just as bad of an investment. They will then turn to hedges against inflation, real assets, further devaluing the dollar. They will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value. Meanwhile, the fed *has* to print more money to account for the deflation of the recession, less they risk their debt becoming more expensive to pay off...further devaluing the dollar. Two fundamental forces acting on the increase in the value of assets. And there is a reciprocating effect, the more the fed prints the more incentive people have to leave the dollar the less businesses see real capital investors and the more deflation we see...Meaning the fed has to print more to account for it's debt starting from step 1 all over again. Hyper-inflation, as usual in the end of the fractional reserve banking cycle. The same thing happened in 1979 when silver prices were $100/oz and in 1938. And pretty much every 30-50 years since fractional reserve banking was first used (TMK) in the 13th century.

There is a notion in the investment community that gold and silver are the next big tulip crazes, and thus we should stay away. I think this is backwards, IMO the bubble is the *dollar* over the past 30 years and it's peak was in 2000 when gold hit rock bottom a symptom of the dotcom no less. You're partaking in the bubble by staying in dollars or the economy which is in recession, the *only* way out is real assets.

0,1422965334.0,"I've been working in institutional CRE for about 10 years, but primarily with individual deals, not public markets. Until recently I'd never paid more than cursory attention to REIT sector as a whole. I've worked a bit with CMBS and have been shocked at the lack of transparency REITS have relative to CMBS. Here are my initial conclusions on REIT transparency problems (feedback welcomed, especially if something seems wrong!):

* REIT companies either don't estimate or report property valuations
* The analyst community also doesn't value properties (and at most applies a general cap rate to the NOI produced by the entire portfolio)
* Property revenue and expense line-items are not reported
* NOI for individual properties is not reported (but sometimes a company-level NOI is reported)
* Rent rolls are not reported
* Acquisition dates and acquisition prices are not maintained or reported in a standardized format 
* Property level mortgage financing terms are not reported
* Number of properties, property square footage, property city/MSA, property type are not reported in a standardized format


I contrast this with the public debt market (CMBS) where:

* At issuance, every property has a 3rd-party appraisal, rating agency commentary, and rating agency stressed appraised values
* After issuance, the analyst community (KBRA, others) have valuation staff search for comparable sales, analyzes NOI durability, and perform quarterly/annual/as-needed valuation updates on the most significant properties (and all distressed properties)
* Rent rolls are reported in a standardized format. Lease rollover tracking is robust among rating agencies and data vendors. 
* NOI, including revenue and expense line-items, is standardized for every CMBS property (and reported quarterly)
* All the additional property information listed in the REIT section above is  tracked by many competing data vendors (Trepp, Morningstar, KBRA, Bloomberg, etc)


Why do these low-risk (~4% yield) CRE mortgages have so much better transparency than the first-loss REIT equity pieces? A large REIT value component is acquisitions and management's ability to maximize value, but I would think valuing REITS via the Net Asset Value method should still be more robust than a portfolio wide cap rate. My speculation is that:

* REITs are older than CMBS, and were created when Excel didn't exist and investor transparency was much worse. 
* REIT issuers have no incentive to lobby for increased transparency requirements due to the added cost (and possibly the reduced ways in which they can make money)
* The REIT analyst community has no incentive to lobby for increased transparency because they have established ways to analyze and report on companies with the existing structure (there isn't an alternative public REIT 2.0 universe of securities)
* The only meaningful REIT data vendor (SNL) has no incentive to lobby for increased transparency because they have a monopoly on the [very] limited available data.
* The only group who should want increased transparency is the investor, but that group has made very little noise on the topic as far as I can tell (by comparison, CMBS has the CREFC working group that can, and does, demand what the issuers and servicers will report)

0,1488917861.0,"I've noticed throughout my years in business school that many students struggle with making assumptions.  I'm not sure if this is a prevalent issue (which is kinda why I'm here) but in my experience, the idea of making an assumption **based in reality** is almost staggering to people.  

TLDR AT THE BOTTOM...

I took one class which involved creating pro formas with projections for a rolling 4 year period.  While making these projections, we made assumptions based on sales (the 'business' was a computer company in the early years of consumer PCs).  So we did things from buying a factory (and managing factory capacity) to R&D to marketing.  All of these inputs were then put into a simulation program which 'judged' the efficacy of our inputs (advertising, capacity, production of different computers, sales tactics, # of employees, basically every aspect of a fully vertically integrated computer company).

The assumptions that some of my group members wanted to make were, to be blunt, pretty cringey.  I'll cut them slack on the first one since we had no historical data, but when we arrived in the 3rd-4th periods, people still had no idea what to do.  Manufacturing had 'decent' data on sales growth and whatnot and she would just insist on raising capacity by an arbitrary number.  That's essentially what it boiled down into.  People wanting to make assumptions based on arbitrary bases.  

I suggested we do a 'test period' where we make calculated moves and see how that affects our bottom line, basically to feel out the simulation and to see how the inputs would affect the output.  They were basically confused as to why we'd want to do that and basically showed no understanding of a computer program/its input-output style of logic.

So all of this culminated into horrible pro forma projections.  We'd base sales off of nothing and just assume that they'd increase by 20% every period, or some other arbitrary amount.  No one had any idea how to create good and realistic assumptions.  We'd talk about R&D and no one even thought about just looking up the prices of different R&D ventures (prices were listed per R&D upgrade) to see how much we'd spend based on what kinds of things we wanted.  Instead, they'd rather 'budget' a $10M expense for it in one year, when we could literally just see what upgrades we wanted and how much that'd cost.  AKA basing their assumptions off of nothing.

I don't have experience working with professionals on this too much.  I can tell teachers and whatnot who have done this for years often cover all the bases when they speak and they talk like they know how pro formas affect different line items and whatnot.  They display extensive knowledge of how changes can affect different areas of financial statements.  My current finance teacher with a PhD in math is a good example of this.  He recognizes that if you increase sales over a period of time, you need the infrastructure/capacity to handle it, how the increases in the capacity affect the bottom line, the new employees required to handle the increased capacity (unless you replace labor with capital).  Etc etc.  It's hard to really explain but it's very noticeable when talking to him that he really understands whats going on with financial statements and how 1 change can affect more than 1 other line item.

Contrast that to a student (and yes, my professor has obviously been doing it much longer) but it's alarming how little people can accomplish when they aren't given flat out what happens and how it affects everything.  In the same vein, many students cannot properly do a sensitivity analysis, where they make assumptions about the future based on differing levels of activity and how it affects the bottom line.  Many, without guidance, cannot simply assume that you'd want maybe 3 different environments, 1 with low demand, 1 with normal demand, 1 with extraordinary demand (obviously you could get much more in depth).  Or that you'd want to obviously account for necessary increases in capacity if you want to be able to handle the increase in demand/sales.  

It's hard to articulate properly but what I've boiled it down to is an inability to apply logic.  The same thing happens when you give someone a problem with no instructions.  They have no idea where to begin or what to do.  

If there is anyone here, such as teachers or recruiters, who regularly come into contact with young students/professionals who are entering the work force, have you noticed this 'phenomenon'?  I don't like to go off personal experience too much but it's almost universal at my school that students have trouble dealing with making assumptions and applying it to pro forma projections.  

Which is why I've been thinking about creating a 'training program' designed to help students go through the process of making assumptions about the future and seeing the outcome based on their assumptions.  The point isn't to develop people's 'future telling' abilities but more nuanced than that--to help people apply logic and help them go through the process of understanding a scenario and what the goals are, what the ramifications are for certain decisions, etc.  I know it's a vague concept but I do have a creative way of designing this training program in mind, but I want to know if it's something that would really be necessary or not.  I would obviously program it myself and my programming background has actually helped me a lot in finance, since I look at a pro forma basically like an extensively programmed Excel spreadsheet/a general program that accepts inputs and spits out an output based on an underlying function.

Any ideas or thoughts?

Tl;dr:  I've noticed students suck at making assumptions/applying logic so I've been thinking about creating a program to help 'train' students to think in the way a business executive would who is planning for the future.  Being able to make proper assumptions is pivotal in the planning aspect of running a business and it's often why businesses are so successful--because they always have a plan for any circumstance/situation that might arise.  And this plan is helpful because they know, today, if something happens in the future, what they must do, how it will affect their pro formas, and what it could mean for the company.  And it works because it's realistic and accounts for the whole machine that a business is.  They understand that it's an intricate machine with cogs that turn and, in turn, make other cogs spin. I've noticed a lot of students struggle with this process and I've been thinking about creating a program to help people think through the process.  

EDIT:  Also, are there any similar programs you guys have seen and your opinions on them if you've tried them before.  

To bring this full circle, the whole point is to understand business better and to be able to make better business decisions using better data.  So it'd all focus on financial statements and would be from the perspective of a business/from a business perspective, not so much other fields).

And please excuse the hodge podge anecdote, it was simply to demonstrate the kind of thinking I've seen from other people and how it contributes to an overall lack of understanding.  The simulation we used in that class is what I'd model my training program off of but with many improvements.  So the one being trained would probably act from the perspective of a business owner/CFO.  

EDIT2:  If anyone is still here thanks for the input I'm still reading everything that gets added.  ",PH

0,1363982716.0,"Question for the more quantitative folks here - I know there are some PhDs around.

I work for what could be generally described as a value-oriented, global equity long/short fund. We are looking at a private investment (to be public in the next 5 years) and are estimating cost of equity capital. We like to use the market-derived capital pricing model (MCPM) as a backup for CAPM or other models (this is not meant to be a debate about the MCPM, but for more details, see [here](http://www.cosinconsulting.com.br/WebSite/artigos/What_is_your_real_cost_of_capital.pdf)).

One of the primary inputs to the MCPM is volatility. However, as this investment in particular is private we lack a volatility input, although we have several good public market proxies. In this case the expected leverage of the investment in question is higher than the market proxies. **Is there a reasonable method for estimating the volatility of the equity of this firm, given the public market proxies?**

From a quick read, it looks as though B-S-M worked on this and viewed the equity volatility as a function of firm value volatility and leverage, where the volatility of debt is assumed to be zero, i.e. firm value volatility = (debt / firm value) * debt volatility + (equity / firm value) * equity volatility, simplifying to equity volatility = (firm value / equity) * firm value volatility.

Curious if we are thinking about this the correct way and if there are any other methods. Thanks.",PH
0,1338829969.0,"Hey Reddit. So I'm early 30's, have a Ph.D. in chemistry from a top tier institute (think Harvard, Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Yale...), and I transitioned out of lab work about 6 years ago. Ended up on the academic administration track, currently as one of several Deans at a top tier research institution in the northeast.

Have some solid quant skills (e.g. research experience in dynamical systems, have done 1 or 2 basic stochastic models), rudimentary programming skills, know my way around Mathematica (but I'm probably quite rusty at this point). Questions: (1) is it feasible for me to transition to a career in finance? (2) What might my career trajectory look like? (3) If I were to start in finance now, how long before I'd reach a salary of $150K? (4) I want a family at some point. Would I be working ridiculous hours? If so, for how many years?

0,1306969125.0,"I'm discovering an interest in both finance and statistics, but only after having gotten out into the workforce with a B.B.A. in MIS and an M.B.A.  I'm rather enjoying reading a book that I bought on ordinary differential equations and pestering a friend who's doing his Ph.D in stats about statistical concepts.  Unfortunately, there's only so far that I can take myself without formal instruction, as the mathematical literature is terse, to put it gently.  Does anyone know how I should go about getting the requisite knowledge, skills, and documentation for this?  

I'm thinking that I should probably go talk to the local university (Ohio State) and see if I can roll my own degree.  Of course at that point, do I do an MS or go for a Ph.D?  And would it be better to try to work it on the side along with a full-time job or just cut out entirely and go full-time student?  The idea of dropping out of the workforce for four to five years just does not sound appealing.

I know that I'd need to beef up on some computer science (2 years of PHP and some dabbling in Python, where I need to get heavy in C and C++) as well as really hit the math hard.

Any thoughts, r/finance?

Thank you all for your comments.  I think that what I'm going to do is settle into my new job, study up on my own some more, and then see if I can get my employer to pay for a few classes at a time while I truck my way through a Ph.D. preferably with a master's along the way, if I can get classes to double-up.

Many current published and working papers reference the NYSE's System Order Data (SOD) database.  

For example, Hendershott, Jones, and Menkveld (i.e. ""Does Algorithmic Trading Improve Liquidity?"", Journal of Finance 2011) state,

> In the case of the NYSE, electronic message traffic includes order submissions, cancellations, and trade reports that are handled by the NYSE’s SuperDOT system and captured in the NYSE’s System Order Data (SOD) database.

0,1346774293.0,"Recently our company, which has some PhDs (mostly math), but mostly Masters level employees, hired a finance PhD from a top 5 institute because we did not have any finance PhD. Everyone told us to get a finance PhD in the research department because they know lot more than the Math PhDs.

You won't believe it, it has been 6 months of hell and finally we got rid him, I am so traumatized with this episode that I have asked a friend of mine to post this to suitable audience and he referred me here.

To begin with he was from a top 5 institute, we paid top dollars to get him on board. From day one he acted as if we were a second rate place for him and we all should collectively be thankful that we got an opportunity to spend time with this genius. He offended practically everyone at work. The height was when the evening Janitor refused to go alone to his desk because it smelled awful and this guy was practically eating rotten food, cooked a week ago. Our office secretary complained to the HR director that this guy had no manners at all. We all thought he was a genius and tolerated his disgusting behavior.

I was shocked a month into hiring this guy that he had no sense of how investments worked. He was supposed to be researching high yield sector with long duration and he had no clue what that meant and we gave him all the books that we would give to a new undergrad hire, he was unable to comprehend the information. Then we put him through our training program and this guy insulted the instructor who is known as a wizard in our company, because he had ""only a masters"" degree and unfit to teach this guy.

After couple of incidents, we read the riot act to him and he did not know what was happening. He kept asking us for work that could be published, yet he had the lowest IQ in our whole company. Our secretary honestly knew more about finance than this guy.

Nobody in our company has ever worked with a Finance PhD and I don't think we ever will. What a moronic idiot he was.

The question is, what do they teach in these programs? Could somebody provide a link of subjects/topics/classes that are taught in a finance phd program?

    1     574.19    562.51    -11.68          -2.03

    3     571.99    572.93      0.94           0.16

In other words, ""the market"" index went down $11.68 or -2.03% on day 1. Now asssume that I have bought and sold the following stocks on each of these 3 days:


    day   stock     open     close    return (abs)    return (%)
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    1     HPQ       40.81    40.14    -0.67           -1.64

    3     PEP       63.49    63.24    -0.25           -0.39

So on day 1, I bought and sold HPQ for a return of -$0.67 or -1.64%. I now want to calculate, in %, how my trades performed against the market:

    day    market return (%)    my return (%)    excess return (%)

    1      -2.03                -1.64             0.39  (-1.64 - -2.03)

    total  -0.78                -4.15            -3.37  (-4.15 - -0.78)

For instance, on day 1 the market (S&P100 index) went down 1.64% but the stock I bought only went down 1.64%. In other words, my trade ""outperformed"" the market by 0.39%. When totalling, the market lost 0.78% during the three days, but my trades lost -4.15%. The way I interpret this, my trades underperformed 3.37% against the market.

Alternatively, if I take the first (574.19) and last (572.93) price of the market indexfund, the market only declined ((572.93 - 574.19) / 574.19) * 100 = -0.22%. Based on this number, my trades underperformed the market by -3.37 - -0.22 = -3.15%

**Question 1** How do the 2 market performances that I calculated (-0.78% and -0.22%) relate to each other?

**Question 2** How do I correctly culculate the relative performance of my trades against the market? Is is -3.37% or -3.15%? And if it's neither, how do I calculate with how many % my trading outperformed (or underperformed) the market?",PEP

If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

0,1428697172.0,"Hello all, at the recommendation of a poster in a related sub about the benefits of hiring a resume writer, I bought an online service for $85. The service touted the benefits of doing so and assured me that a professional with significant experience writing and reviewing resumes in the finance industry would be handling my work. 

I just received the final product and am very displeased. There's repeat information, and it seems painfully apparent that the writer had no idea how to digest the information I gave her about my relevant experience I gained in school. Before I contact the company demanding a refund, I was wondering if any of you who have hiring experience would be willing to review what they produced and make sure I'm not being overly critical. 

If you are interested in helping me out, let me know and I'll PM you a link to a copy of it. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. ",PM
0,1432224937.0,"Hello,
I know the question can seem a bit broad, but I was wondering if somebody with experience in the industry could enlight me about how portfolio management is done in Mutual Funds.

I have kind of a model in mind, but don't know exactly if I am right, and to what extent that is close to what actually happens :

- Analysts in the fund come up with arguments as to why some firms are undervalued and the fund should invest in them. Come up with price/return forecasts.
- The fund manager builds an ideal portfolio based on that, with a proportion invested into each stock.
- Every so often (how often ?) the fund rebalances its portfolio.

What makes the fund decide to trade ? Is it just trying to track the portfolio (but then I guess it would cost it a lot to trade very often), or does it simply decide to trade once a month/quarter ?
If somebody could help me understand, you know, the whole process from idea/investment decision to actual trade, that'd be very helpful.
Thanks",PM

0,1378322918.0,"I was offered a job at a Broker firm which sponsored me for my series 7 (passed) and 63 (supposed to take this Sunday).  I began working yesterday and found out it was a 100% cold calling job.  I originally thought it was 70% this plus some other tasks.  The job was 13 hour workdays (7:30 AM - 8 PM) and the first 3 months were training, in which I would be paid $300/week.  

Yesterday, on my first day, I was given a script to memorize about a stock to sell which included me lying to the customer (saying I had spoken to them before earlier in the year about a stock that had jumped in price 40% and that they missed out on the investment).  I spent about 5 hours yesterday and another 7 hours today cold calling people with about 6 total pitches (reading the script all the way through) and 0 clients.  I felt very guilty about this whole ordeal and very dirty because I felt like I was lying to people and then even if they say they are not invested (politely) I am supposed to ignore them and continue with the script until they hang up.

I quit on my 2nd day, because this is not what I thought I had signed up for.  I feel like it isn't a waste of time because I did get my series 7 out of this, so only the past 2 days were a waste, I feel like...although did learn what I don't want to do.

My question is are all broker firms similar to this type of job?  Of course there need to be some amount of cold calling, but are there people who work at these firms that devote 100%of their time to this task?

Sorry for the big rant, just wanted to provide the specifics of what went down the past few days.  There are more things, but I think I covered most of what was bothering me.

0,1384915605.0,"Hi Redditors! 

I'm a graduate student in a finance class, and have been basically stymied by an efficient portfolio question that I feel like should be easier than I'm making it. 

Here's what's given:

* I am currently invested in AAPL and treasury bills (I assume the t-bills are ""risk-free"")
* I have $1,000,000. $700,000 is invested in AAPL, $300,000 is in the t-bills
* AAPL has a Beta of 1.2 and an R-squared of 0.30, and assume that CAPM holds. 
* Risk Free Rate is 7%
* Market Rate is 15%

From all of this, I gathered that the expected return on the portfolio is 13.72%, because:

    (.7 x [.07+ 1.2 x (.15-.07)]) + (.3 x .07) = 13.72%

I am unsure how to calculate the portfolio's current variance or standard deviation (volatility)

**But** the problem is that this portfolio isn't efficient. How do I make it efficient? I think I want to find a portfolio that returns 13.72% with a smaller variance. 

Any help would be really appreciated, or feel free to PM me. I'm very confused, and just want to figure out how to do these types of problems because I'm sure I'll be tested on it. I've spent hours trying to figure out which formulas might apply, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere, and the professor has not been responsive.

Facebook IPO: The Facts and Figures Behind One Of The Largest Offerings Ever : business
-----
http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ol64e/facebook_ipo_the_facts_and_figures_behind_one_of/　

What I have uncovered is that there a lot of favoritism that goes on when investment bankers allocate stocks to investors during the pre-IPO process. 
**How an pre-IPO offering is setup**
The simplified flow of a pre-IPO offering is that A) a company considering an IPO chooses an Investment Banker (bookmaker). B) This bookmaker has his own circle of investor friends and likely also some kind of retail outlet and/or contacts with other circles of rich investors. This is called the syndicate. C) The bookmaker or book runner creates a prospectus explaining all the potential pitfalls of this IPO release and then goes around to his syndicate of investors and takes orders. D) Investors bid on what they think the offering is worth and how much stock they want to purchase. This is called “price discovery”. E) Once all the orders are taken the bookmakers then allocate stocks based on how much was offered. ***Here is where the unfairness exists*** F) The bookmaker allocates based upon which investor he has a better relationship with. The retail sales (the little guy that buys through a broker or something) gets little to nothing, and the big investors get massive allocations. The thing is, these deals are set up to always be about 15% *even before the IPO release*. Then upon release the price is setup to make at least another 15% by being intentionally under priced (so they don’t loose any money [no risk])

If I am wrong about any part of this please let me know but the point is that the allocation process is flawed and not fair. It screws the little guy and even the small/mid-sized investor.

Pretty much, I'm a student at UCSB who has recently become interested in pursuing I-Banking. As it looks, I currently don't have an internship lined up for this summer, which I know will hurt me, but I'm hoping its not THAT big of a problem. If I can't find an analyst position in the next few weeks, I plan on working my ass off over summer reading and researching what it means to be an I-Banker. 

I understand how competitive the industry is, and as such I decided to potentially sacrifice my social life and friendships I've made in exchange for the opportunity to go to a better school with more opportunities. I was accepted into USC (as an econ transfer, but will transfer into business if I go) and waitlisted to Vanderbilt as econ. My question for you folks is what you think would be the smartest option for reaching a BB after my undergraduate education? USC, Vandy, or UCSB? 

I'm aware that none of these schools are target schools, but I have heard good things about west coast banking at USC and east coast/south for vandy. I love UCSB, I love the people, the atmosphere, my fraternity, and the weather. However, I'm getting to a point in my life where the decisions I make are becoming much more important, and I am willing to sacrifice what I have developed at UCSB for more opportunities to break into Ibanking/PE/hedge funds

Masayoshi Son is finally disclosing the damage from SoftBank Group Corp.’s bets on WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.
The Japanese investment powerhouse on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years -- about $6.5 billion --after writing down the value of a string of marquee investments. It swallowed a charge of 497.7 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for WeWork, whose spectacular implosion turned the once high-flying shared-office startup into a Silicon Valley punchline.


The losses call into question the billionaire founder Son’s deal-making approach just as he’s trying to raise an even larger successor to his $100 billion Vision Fund. The investment vehicle had been a driver of profit growth at SoftBank, contributing over $14 billion in mostly paper gains over the past two years. The shrinking valuation of Uber and WeWork, once among the brightest stars in the SoftBank constellation, also raises the prospects of more writedowns in the Vision Fund’s portfolio with its high exposure to businesses that prioritize growth over profitability.
“Son’s handling of WeWork raises some fundamental questions about his investment strategy that need to be addressed,” Jefferies Group senior analyst Atul Goyal said ahead of the earnings release. “There will be more failed investments in the future, how does he plan to handle them?”


The operating loss was 704.4 billion yen in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement. That easily surpassed the 230.8 billion yen average of analysts’ projections, and compared with a 705.7 billion yen profit a year earlier. Its signature Vision Fund -- the world’s single largest pool of startup investments -- reported a 970.3 billion yen loss in the quarter.


SoftBank reported 537.9 billion yen of unrealized losses in a plethora of investments from Uber to WeWork. Analysts had predicted a charge to be in excess of $5 billion and as much as $7 billion. The co-working startup was valued at $7.8 billion at the end of September -- a precipitous fall from about $47 billion in January.


Late last month, WeWork secured a $9.5 billion rescue package from SoftBank, a deal that handed 80% of the company to the Japanese conglomerate. That’s on top of the more than $10 billion SoftBank and its Vision Fund have already invested into the co-working giant. SoftBank has said it didn’t get a majority of voting rights, meaning its troubled investee will be treated as an associate, not a subsidiary -- potentially keeping its balance sheet free of some $22 billion of debt and $47 billion in looming lease-payment obligations.


The deal includes $5 billion in new financing and an acceleration of a $1.5 billion existing commitment. SoftBank will also offer to buy as much as $3 billion from existing shareholders. WeWork’s founder Adam Neumann left the company’s board as part of the package, replaced by SoftBank executive and newly appointed Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure.",POOL

0,1542928255.0,"I wanted to put up a discussion thread to talk to people on this theory. I'd come across it in my undergrad years and just recently re-visited the theory.

Here's a Wikipedia link. The basic idea is this: ""In the absence of taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information, and in an efficient market, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed"".

And this: ""Consider two firms which are identical except for their financial structures. The first (Firm U) is unlevered: that is, it is financed by equity only. The other (Firm L) is levered: it is financed partly by equity, and partly by debt. The Modigliani–Miller theorem states that the value of the two firms is the same.""

I work in Structured Credit where Asset-Backed Securities are issued, and my gut reaction is that if this theory were true - even including all the assumptions stated - a great deal of securitized products would not be issued.

For background, there are broadly two reasons a securitization would be issued: If the issuer wants to get attractive non-recourse leverage on a pool of their assets (ie they retain the equity) or if they want to sell a portfolio of assets completely, and believe that the sum of proceeds from the debt and equity they sell would be greater than the proceeds from selling an unlevered asset pool (ie they sell the equity to a third party). This second reason flies in the face of Modigliani Miller. But issuers sell third-party equity all the time.

~~It seems to me that what MM doesn't address is that debt investors and equity investors are disparate market segments, each with their own supply/demand dynamics. If there's a glut of capital chasing BBB opportunities they would push down the yields on BBB bonds. The same for AAA and the same for 10%+ yielding equity residuals. Given that there are all different market segments, it seems completely possible that the WACC of a company's funding structure would not be the same as the ROA. And, as far as I'm aware, all of that can happen in a market that is still efficient.~~

I understand that economic theories are usually highly abstracted, and often so general (or involving so many assumptions) that they don't directly point to the truth in economics, but only address partial truths.

So I wanted to put it up to a discussion. What do you think are the merits of the theory?

**Edit 11-28-2018:** Thanks to everyone who took an interest in the thread! I wanted to follow-up with a couple pieces of research for anyone interested.

A slide deck from NYU:

Pages 10-11 are the relevant ones here. 

A lot of what has been written regarding MM and Securitization focuses on why it makes sense to split assets out from your company and finance them off-balance sheet with a securitization. This is interesting but not what I was focused on, which was primarily, why would it make sense to securitize a pool and sell the whole stack instead of just selling the unlevered pool to a third party. In both of those cases you're getting the pool off-balance sheet by selling it. 

I think my point above about ""disparate market segments"" isn't the real answer. The NYU slide deck and the WashU Law paper above spend some time on the liquidity boost from securitization. I think this is much more compelling. It's much easier to sell out of a cusip than an asset pool, and because of this the asset pool is likely to carry an illiquidity yield premium.",POOL

Everyone seems so up in arms about HFT and claim that it is an unfair tax on regular market participants. Pretending for a moment that this claim is in fact true, why is IEX's ""speed bump"" (i.e., the slowing down of orders to prevent HFT's from executing some sort of latency based arb strategy) a solution to the problem (again acknowledging that there is one whether its true or not). It seems to me that HFT's rely on relative speed, not absolute speed vs regular institutional investors. So even if there is a bump down in all speeds, wouldn't the fact that HTF's employ faster algorithms and collocate closer to the exchange still make them relatively faster than institutional investors and thus able to execute their strategy. 

Also, another problem I had with the IEX model was that HFT's pay money to the exchange for access to the direct feed which is faster than the SIP. They do this because they can't beat the orders executed on the exchange that they pay to look at (this is true because the nature of the direct feed is that it is historic - the orders have already be executed) but see if there are overflow orders that would get executed on another exchange and then take the opposite position of the overflow order on the other exchange to make risk-less profit. So my question is how can one exchange's speed bump (pretending here too that a speed bump is a solution) prevent HFT's from executing their latency strategies on other exchanges (i.e., beating the overflow orders to other exchanges).

> When you invest in a mortgage-backed security you are essentially lending money to a home buyer or business. An MBS is a way for a smaller regional bank to lend mortgages to its customers without having to worry about whether the customers have the assets to cover the loan. Instead, the bank acts as a middleman between the home buyer and the investment markets. 

> This type of security is also commonly used to redirect the interest and principal payments from the pool of mortgages to shareholders. These payments can be further broken down into different classes of securities, depending on the riskiness of different mortgages as they are classified under the MBS.

Another common investment platform is the [asset-backed security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset-backed_security). These are essentially the same thing as mortgage-backed securities, but are backed by various other assets. Again, I'll quote Investopedia:

> An ABS is essentially the same thing as a mortgage-backed security, except that the securities backing it are assets such as loans, leases, credit card debt, a company's receivables, royalties and so on, and not mortgage-based securities.

**Let's Invest in People**

I realize this may sound crass at first, but stay with me for a minute. Why can't we create a new investment platform that quite literally **allows you to invest in people**. There are countless individuals for whom the ""American dream"" is out of reach. I'm referring to smart kids who can't afford to go to college, the homeless, etc...

**Education-Backed Securities**

> In essence... a kickstarter for people.

In much the same way that financial institutions create packages of securities based on home mortgage payments and other tangible assets, could we not create a kind of ""education-backed security"" (EBS) investment platform that allows people to invest in those for whom a dignified and satisfying way of life is out of reach by paying to put them through college and provide for their basic needs (housing, food) throughout the course of their education? I realize that ""student loans"" already exist, but what I'm proposing goes way beyond  that. I'm talking about a systemic, capitalistic approach to lifting people out of poverty by providing for all of their needs and giving them an education for four years - an approach that allows *everyone* to add capital to the pool. A system that perpetuates itself by providing real financial incentives to backers of the program. In essence... a **kickstarter for people**.

**The Math**

- In 2002, the Census Bureau determined that [the average college graduate earns 75% more](http://education-portal.com/articles/How_Much_More_Do_College_Graduates_Earn_Than_Non-College_Graduates.html) than their uneducated peers - $2,700,000 over their course of their lifetime.

- According to [collegedata.com](http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064), the average price of a college education at a public university (including room and board) stands at roughly $20,000. Let's be generous and round it off to $100,000 for a four-year college degree.

- Let's also assume that our education-backed security (EBS) matures over a span of twenty years.

- If a recipient of the program goes on to earn a salary of $50,000 and pays back interest payments at 15% every year for twenty years, that original investment of $100,000 turns into $150,000 - a profit of $50,000 for the investor(s).

**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 9.05am  
Announcement – New strategic focus for All Options**
  
  
Dear Colleagues,
  
We are in the midst of a market that has changed significantly. As many of you know, market making, our core business model, is dependent upon volume, and volume has died out in many of our markets. Today we see an environment where technology is critical, where the volumes in the underlying stock markets are declining, where investors seek safe and secure investments, where trading is being centralized into larger blocks of trade and dark pools, or going off-exchange completely. In addition, no one can predict when the markets will recover, if at all. This is not the market conditions the company was designed for in its current form. We as a company must change, we need to have a strong focus on what we are good at. Market making as we experienced it is dying out and we need to evolve. We are a trading company – and we need to focus on how we can get that profitable trading business back. 
  
What we intend to do is move away from primary market making obligations that lose us money, to focusing on sophisticated proprietary trading strategies in markets where we can gain real value, stopping loss making markets, reducing our traded-products portfolio, simplifying our infrastructure, and investing in dedicated technology.
  
With deep sadness I need to tell you that one of the unfortunate ramifications for this new strategy is that today we have to tell you that we will be closing our office in Hong Kong. The target date for closure of the HK office will be 1st January, 2011. I thank the team there for all of their efforts and hard work. We will however remain present in one of the Asian markets with our development of technology for Korea.
  
We also preparing to implement the new strategy in our Willemstad and Zug offices, with the international Managing Directors being informed this morning. In addition, I will personally be informing all of the Amsterdam employees more about the changes in a town-hall meeting at 13:00 today, in the Mercury Hall / Mercurius zaal at BP5. Please can everyone attend.
   
We need to embrace change and truly make the very best of it, we cannot dwell in the past and need to create a new winning team spirit and focus. Only then we can survive in today’s environment.
   
With best regards,  
Allard W. Jakobs  
On behalf of the Board of Directors  
     
**Strategic announcement distributed to all AO employees – 21/09 15.07pm   
Announcement – Further update on new strategic focus**
  
  
Dear Colleagues
   
I would like to outline more details to the intended new strategic focus for the company, which I also announced earlier today in person to the Amsterdam staff.
 
As a company that relied primarily on market making we were operating in market conditions unlike anything encountered in the last ten years. In many of our derivatives markets volume has dropped significantly, volatilities are flat, margins thin and investors are seeking other routes for their investments. What this means is that we were losing money in positions that we were obliged to take as a primary market maker.
 
In these new times, we need to change, to evolve our trading approach to take advantage of our position in markets where we can build stable revenues. What I intend to do, and which is now being reviewed by the Amsterdam Works Council, is a new focus for our company.
 
The aim of this strategy is to increase revenues by putting more focus on profitable markets, to align current cost levels with our lower revenues, and to re-establish the balance between our IT and business support group size in line with Trading.
 
To implement this strategy there will be three functional areas in the company: Trading, IT and Business Support.

The key developments in Trading will be:

* Simplify our trading infrastructure – have one office in Amsterdam, one clearing house, and one trading platform

* We intend to stop trading on loss making markets and focus only on those markets where Trading believe profitable trades are possible and are supported by ScreenTrader

* Closure of the Hong Kong office

* Simplify our product portfolio – reduce it from the 350 traded products we have now

* We intend to stop bidding for PMM memberships in unprofitable markets

* To reduce loss making broker flow by focusing on trades that generate value for the company

* We intend to stop all other loss making or marginal trading activities including ceasing with algo trading and 
energy trading

* Maintaining a small trading strategy group to do fundamental trading research: instrumental in developing new proprietary trading strategies

* Maintain our dedication on continual professional development for all traders
   
For IT the key developments are:
   
* Make IT Services one integrated team

* Continue to invest in the V2 trading platform with renewed focus on the markets we believe we can gain value from

* Relaunch AtomPro for all of our IT activities with a strong focus on the development of new technology


For business support, the proposed changes are intended to better realign the various support functions to more adequately match the size and scope of our intended new trading operations. Several departments will see staff reductions and we will integrate all of the Amsterdam staff into one building.
   
I do understand that this proposed new structure is a big change and you will all no doubt have many questions and concerns.
 
As I stated in my live presentation, I am ready and willing to take any questions you have, but recommend that you first talk to your department manager.
 
These changes are necessary for the company to continue to be a challenger in the markets. Only then can we survive in today’s environment.
 
With best regards

0,1429111877.0,"Morgan Stanley is nearing a deal to sell its oil-trading and storage business, potentially bringing to a close the bank’s lengthy effort to jettison the unit.

Trading firm Castleton Commodities International LLC has emerged as the leading bidder and is offering more than $1 billion for the business, according to people familiar with the situation. Castleton’s backers include hedge-fund heavyweights Glenn Dubin and Paul Tudor Jones.

Morgan Stanley and Castleton are still in discussions, and any deal—if one is struck—is still weeks away. The New York bank has attempted twice before to unload the business, first in 2012, when it couldn’t agree on terms with Qatar’s sovereign-wealth fund, and then in 2014, when an agreement with Russian oil company Rosneft OAO unraveled amid tensions over Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.

Wall Street banks are shedding their physical-commodity operations amid a slump in raw-materials prices and pressure from regulators and politicians. The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns that the dangers associated with producing and transporting commodities pose a systemic risk to the financial system.

Officials say incidents such as the BP PLC Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico could saddle banks active in the sector with destabilizing liabilities.

Taking the place of big banks are privately held commodity-trading firms that operate across borders and face less regulatory scrutiny and lighter disclosure requirements. A sale to Castleton would reinforce this trend.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman has told the bank’s board that selling the oil business remains a priority for 2015, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal is an important part of his strategy to shrink the portion of the firm’s balance sheet tied to debt, currency and commodities trading to less than $180 billion by year-end.

The issue has been a key focus during quarterly earnings conference calls with analysts. Morgan Stanley reports first-quarter results Monday.

The bank has remained active in physical commodities trading during the sale process. This year, the bank has leased almost two dozen tankers to haul more than a million barrels of refined-fuel products around the world, with the U.S. Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast frequent destinations, according to records available from data provider Reuters.

Morgan Stanley also has been supplying gasoline-blending components to Northeastern U.S. facilities operated by Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Motiva Enterprises LLC, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company.

Castleton, based in Stamford, Conn., evolved from a spinoff of Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group’s energy-trading business several years ago.

Its owners include Mr. Dubin, a co-founder of $30 billion asset manager Highbridge Capital Management, which was later sold to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Mr. Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corp. Castleton’s chief executive is William C. Reed II, onetime head of power trading at Enron Corp.

Castleton’s bid topped that of the other contenders for Morgan Stanley’s unit, including Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd. and private-equity giant KKR Inc., according to people familiar with the talks.

Castleton and KKR had previously submitted a joint bid for J.P. Morgan’s physical-commodity assets when they were on the block in 2013. That business was ultimately sold to Swiss trading house Mercuria Energy Trading Inc. Castleton and KKR bid separately this time.

J.P. Morgan sold its physical-commodities business last year, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. divested a chain of metals warehouses in December. The Fed is preparing tighter restrictions on banks that trade commodities.

The value of physical assets would constitute much of the sale price. Those assets include barrels of oil and fuel, leases for pipeline capacity and storage terminals, supply and marketing agreements with oil companies and a 49% stake in a company that operates pools of tanker ships, Heidmar Holdings LLC. Those values could fluctuate in line with market prices.

The bank had $1.6 billion in tradable assets such as crude oil at the end of 2014, according to its most recent holding report filed with the Fed.

The other part of the price would be a premium, or the value assigned to the trading franchise Morgan Stanley has established in the oil market. The bank has been seeking premiums in the range of $300 million to $400 million, but the offers have come in the $200 million-to-$300 million range, according to people familiar with the talks.",POOL

0,1437091036.0,"The first U.S. credit union opened in 1909. From the beginning, credit unions followed a unique concept. They were created not for profit, but to serve members as credit cooperatives. Since then, over 100 years have passed, and there are 6,557 credit unions in the United States serving over 102 million members. Oak Tree wants to celebrate the 100+ years of credit union history by looking back at how credit unions were started.
 
The creation of credit unions is credited to Friedrich Wilheim Raiffeisen, the major of a small German town whose residents were struggling financially. His idea was to create a small pool of the community’s money that would allow the residents to get small loans at a low interest rate. This idea later spread to other countries expanding throughout Europe, India, and making its way to Canada in 1901. Credit unions later expanded into the United States in 1909, with the first credit union opening in New Hampshire. This same year, Massachusetts passes the first state credit union law, which is the Massachusetts Credit Union Act.
 
In the 1920s, credit unions gained popularity in the U.S. as demand for loans grew when people sought loans to buy cars and large household appliances. Credit unions saw a large need in the market for low-interest loans, so they began promoting credit unions to the public and soon after Massachusetts opened up 19 new credit unions. By seeing what a great demand there was for credit unions in the market, philanthropist Edward Filene “organized and Roy Bergengren managed a national association—the Credit Union National Extension Bureau—to promote the establishment of credit unions throughout the United States” (NCUA).
 
In 1934 President Roosevelt passed The Federal Credit Union Act. Growth for credit unions was steady during the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s. In 1970, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund allowed  federal deposit insurance to be extended to credit unions. Also, in 1970, the NCUA was founded to regulate over credit unions. In 1977, more laws were passed that allow credit unions to offer more services to their members. The ’70s was an extraordinary decade for credit unions, as they nearly doubled the number of credit union members during that period of time.
 
The 1980s showed hard times in the United States with double-digit inflation, a recession, and high interest rates, but credit unions still continued to grow. Assets grew steadily despite the fact that the number of credit unions dropped due to mergers.
 
The 1990s brought more changes to credit unions with the Membership Access Act and the signing of the Credit Union Membership Access Act by President Clinton in 1998. In 2008, credit unions endured the 2008 recession and by 2014 there were over 100 million credit union members in the United States. Today credit unions remain strong and follow the same philosophy that they were founded on over 100 years ago. The distinguishing features include:
Democratic governance
Each member has one vote, regardless of the size of the member’s deposits
Member-elected board of directors
Volunteer based
Oak Tree is passionate about the credit union movement and has also reached an important milestone. Founded in 1980, seven of Oak Tree’s employees have been dedicated to Oak Tree and its mission by serving credit unions for over 10 years. An additional five have been with the company for over 15 years. Combined, Oak Tree has over 100+ years of knowledge and experience that has led to indisputable expertise.",POOL
0,1436454844.0,"(Bloomberg) -- You might have heard about the New York Stock Exchange’s trading halt Wednesday. If you were an investor, that’s probably all that happened -- you heard about it.

In a fragmented market where no venue controls more than 16 percent of volume, the halt was almost impossible to detect for anyone but professional traders and brokers, according to Yousef Abbasi of JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. Anyone who wanted to buy or sell stocks could, just not at NYSE.
“Today proves that we have a resilient infrastructure,” said Abbasi, the global market strategist at JonesTrading in New York. “If something goes down, something else picks it up. Trading goes on.”
At the same time, the rupture joins a series of high-profile breakdowns from Knight Trading’s order deluge in August 2012 to the May 2010 flash crash that embolden critics who say the market’s very complexity makes it unreliable.

“Far too many investors are already concerned that our critical trading technology infrastructure is held together by dangling wires and duct tape,” Dave Lauer, co-founder and chief technology officer of Kor Group LLC, wrote in an e-mail Wednesday. “Today definitely doesn’t help dispel that fear.”
The best and worst of electronic markets were on display Wednesday, when a computer malfunction forced a 3 1/2-hour halt on the NYSE that was easily sealed off from other venues. There are so many places to trade now that the NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market have gone from handling 80 percent of volume in 1997 to 40 percent on average last month.

Fragmentation Proponents

“The proponents of more fragmentation in the U.S. market are happy this happened, to show that competition of exchanges is a better thing,” said Frank Maeba, managing partner at Breton Hill Capital in Toronto. “I personally think it’s a bit messy.”

The NYSE’s systems are all functioning normally in Thursday’s trading, the firm said in a statement.
Two people briefed on a preliminary review said the computer malfunction that knocked out trading probably stemmed from a software update that went awry. The NYSE must now verify the cause and report its conclusions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the people, who asked not to be named because the inquiry isn’t public.

Tom Farley, the exchange’s president, made the decision to suspend trading when it became apparent investors couldn’t rely on the market to provide accurate data.

‘Configuration Problem’

“There was a configuration problem in our system,” Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg television. “It likely had to do with an upgrade but that’s premature and it’s something that will come about as part of our full analysis of the situation.”

The suspension, lasting from 11:32 a.m. to just after 3 p.m. New York time, temporarily removed the 223-year-old NYSE from the network of platforms that makes up the American equity market. That network kept running, however, as exchanges such as the Nasdaq Stock Market and Bats Global Markets Inc. picked up the runoff.

“If a client called up and wanted me to execute a trade, I could still do it,” said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. “You can trade U.S. equities on lots of different venues. That’s a plus and minus today.”

The two NYSE venues affected by the shutdown handled about 14 percent of all U.S. stock volume in June, with the rest spread among competitors such as Bats and Nasdaq and dozens of dark pools and other private platforms operated by securities firms.

‘Good Reminder’

Brokers were able to steer orders to buy and sell stocks, even those listed on NYSE, away from their home exchange on a day when concerns about China’s economy and Greece contributed to a 1.7 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the second-biggest decline since March.

The disruption underscored how quickly the calm can be broken in the U.S. stock market, where about $270 billion worth of stocks trade hands each day. Order has occasionally broken down in a system that is spread among 11 different exchanges and dozens of private venues.

“Today is a good reminder on the number of diverse venues out there, which has frustrated traders for a while,” said Craig Viani, vice president at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut. “There are a lot of people out there who long for a consolidated market view, but the byproduct of fragmentation is that it does strengthen market stability.”

Too Many

Eleven exchanges are too many for Themis Trading LLC’s Joe Saluzzi. They exist not to serve individual investors but to make it possible for high-frequency traders to do battle with each other by sniffing out price discrepancies, he said.

“Those are the extra fragmentations you don’t need and are using it just for arbitraging,” Saluzzi said. “You can have three exchanges and you can aggregate liquidity better and get rid of the fragmentation issue. I’d still argue that fragmentation is a bad thing.”

To market watchers like Jaret Seiberg of Guggenheim Securities LLC, nothing that happened Wednesday hurt his confidence in the market’s integrity.

Fragmentation “means there is still robust trading even when a major exchange experiences a technical glitch,” Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. “This is negative for those who complain that market fragmentation is hurting liquidity and small investors.”",POOL

There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

0,1387177297.0,"I am an undergrad in Finance, and I just started reading The Big Short by Michael Lewis. In the second chapter, he says:

>He came to a passage explaining why banks felt they needed credit default swaps at all. It wasn't immediately obivous--after all, the best way to avoid the risk of General Electirc's default on it debt was not to lend to General Electric in the first place. In the beginning, credit default swaps had been a tool for hedging. Some banks had loaned more than they wanted to General Electic because GE has asked for it, and they feared alienating a long-standing client; however another bank changed its mind about the wisdom of lending to GE at all. Very quickly, however, the new derivatives became tools for speculation: A lot of people wanted to make bets on the likelihood of GE's defaulting."" (pg. 30)
>

This brought up a question I had. Who in their right minds would buy a CDS against GE? Which brought upon a bigger question: Who in their right minds would buy a CDS against many of these large corporations? Is it purely speculative? Are there enough individual investors willing to bet against hundred-year-old companies that they buy wiliingly a CDS against large, out-standing companies such as GE? I find it hard to believe a large bank would buy CDSs against such companies. So when a bank decides to hedge against their risk against a company such as GE, Exxon, or Apple, is there a large bank on the other side buying up these CDSs? 

Also, I'm not entirely sure: are CDSs exchange traded, or OTC traded? If they were exchange traded, I can see how individual investors could be purswayed to invest in CDSs against these companies, but if they were OTC traded, how would they convince their contacts who -- I assume -- are much more informed than your average trader?

Much of my knowledge of finance is textbook quality, so I'm not sure of the ""here's the real world"" type answers, so don't assume anything might be too obvious. According to the quote above, it is speculators who are buying these, which I guess leads me to a tangent question: How much speculative buying goes on at large banks? I had assumed most of their buying was much more grounded in quantitative reasoning, and not speculation. Are these other large banks who are buying this on speculation? Could there possibly be other departments within the same bank who are willing to speculate on these CDSs and end up washing out the net hedge against the CDSs?

Sorry if I packed too many questions in one post, but this one little passage brought up a lot of questions for me that, honestly, I hadn't considered when reading the textbook definition of ""credit default swap."" ",PG

0,1418911828.0,"As we all know the ruble is somewhat pegged to oil. Oil can't free-fall forever, it'll hit a stable point and then eventually rise, just as it always does (or maybe not? just a conjecture based on patterns). If so, wouldn't the ruble then regain value? Tell me why I'm an idiot before my rainy day fund goes full Russkie. 

EDIT 1: There has been a lot mentioned about how oil affects the Russian economy, and ultimately the value of the Ruble. So I looked at [historical inflation adjusted oil prices per barrel](http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Historical_Oil_Prices_Table.asp) as well as [historical data on the Ruble](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=RUBUSD%3DX+Interactive#%7B%22range%22%3A%2210y%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%7D) to try to get a better understanding of the correlation between the two, if one exists. I crunched some numbers and had some interesting findings. From 2013 to 2014 the average price of crude/barrel has fallen from about 92.41 to 77.5, a 19.2% decrease. The last time we saw a fall of this magnitude was from 2010-2008 when crude went from 100.01 to 77.1, a 29.7% decrease. It's no coincidence that from 2010-2008, the Ruble saw an 18.3% decrease in value, and now in 2014 we've seen a 27.7% decrease in value. So what does this tell us? Oil prices and the value of the Ruble are related to an extent. 

I have a guess as to what's happening right now with the Ruble. Right now, the Russians are in a pinch with Putin. The Crimea sanctions are preventing the Russians from implementing technology to access more available oil. The sanctions aren't going to be lifted or lightened until Putin stops activity in the Ukraine. In a sense, Russia's economy, and by association the Ruble, is being held hostage in order to get Putin to pull out of the Ukraine. The sanctions are slowly withering the Ruble, so the question to be raised is: Will Putin let it die?",PEG

For this reason I wanted to create a post in hopes of finding some solid ideas. I'll provide a little background, and hopefully some of you will have been in the same situation before and can provide some help.

I graduated in December 2009 with a BSBA in Finance (UNCC) and had an internship with a local B/D who just merged with another B/D. I spent the first few months of my post-grad getting my Series 7 & 66 and Insurance licenses. I was under some scummy Insurance salesmen at first, but then was made an admin under a newly recruited advisor. The owners of the B/D could tell I was burning out b/c my ""superiors"" were pieces of shit and my ""leads"" were cold calls to small businesses in the midst of historically low business confidence. The rep I assist has a book which swings around $40mm on any given day, so I have gained a ton of experience assisting him with this (I help in all aspects of operations). We are ""captive"" reps for the time being because we get multiple expenses covered by our B/D and our office hasn't met it's potential due to two ""merger type events"" since March 2010. 

I have a small book of clients, but because of no marketing budget to draw from to generate leads, I have very little hope that I will see any significant growth any time soon. I have busted my ass building a website and general marketing materials using my prior graphic design experience, but all of that is caught up in compliance for the time being.

I was wondering how some of you other young advisors were able to gather a decent asset base with limited resources. I have a phone interview with Vanguard tomorrow, but after reading multiple reviews on GlassDoor, it seems their pay is shit and morale is pretty low. I want to stay an advisor because I truly enjoy interacting with others and helping them with their investments/life decisions.

0,1431267460.0,"Hi,

I have to do a paper due tomorrow on an investment portfolio game that we did for our investment class. 

Just wondering if anyone could help me interpret the data/make sure I am doing this correctly

I calculated the daily returns of my overall stock/ETF portfolio from the game and subtracted out the rf rate(which is 0%) and then for... 
CAPM: I regressed the daily return minus rf against the mktrf factors for the period during which the stock game was conducted 
Fama French 3-factor: I regressed the daily return minus rf against the mktrf, SMB, and HML factors

So.. after doing so, these are the rounded values for the results I got: 
CAPM: 
R: .71
R^2: .504
Adjusted R^2: .493
Intercept: -0.0001  (insignificant)
Beta: 1.06  (t-stat of approx. 6.7)

Fama French: 
R: .71
R^2: 0.50
Adjusted R^2: .451
Intercept: -0.002  (insignificant)
mktrf: 1.04 (t-stat of approx. 5.3)
SMB: .29 (insignificant)
HML: .27 (insignificant)

(for the ones that have a t-stat between -1.96 and 1.96, I wrote insignificant next to the values)

I was wondering 
1)if I did it correctly?

2)why the R^2 is about the same/a little bit less for the Fama French model than the CAPM model- shouldn't the Fama French model achieve a greater r^2 value, because that would indicate the returns achieved during that period are better explained with the additional 2 factors used in the FF model?

3) how would one interpret the ""mktrf: 1.04 (t-stat of approx. 5.3)""?

and lastly, 

4) why would the alpha of the portfolio which realized in overall return of around -2.75% be almost zero, when the overall market returns(S&P/DOW) during that period were around 4-5%?

Thanks in advance for any help with this, very much appreciated

0,1339533365.0,"Hi,
I’m building a dcf model of mcdonalds and my terminal value is coming out waaaay too high. It’s almost 3x current market value. I’ve looked online for some comparable WACC calculations to see if I’m screwing anything up badly, and all the WACCs I’ve come across for MCD have been quite a bit higher. The problem is, they seem to be calculated improperly, using the wrong beta, way higher cost of debt, or different risk free rate. I’ll list my assumptions and maybe you can point out what’s out of wack with my wacc.

I’m currently using a beta of 0.5145 based on 1 year returns vs the S&P 500. I checked wolfram alpha and the 2 and 5 year betas are virtually identical at about 0.51, so I don’t think the beta is wrong. The risk free rate I am using in the capm model is the 10 year at 1.66%. The expected market return I am using is 6.45% from the quarterly CFO survey. Perhaps I should use implied expected return instead? For the cost of debt I am using the 2011 weighted average debt from the annual report which is 4.2%. These inputs result in 1.66 + 0.5145(6.45-1.66) or about 4.12% as a cost of equity. Given a 0.1354 debt/equity ratio and effective tax rate of 31.3% I end up with a WACC of 3.98% or so.

If I use the 30 year bond rate of 2.77 instead of the 10 yearI still get over 2x current market value for my DCF value. The WACC just seems very low. Lowering  my long-term growth rate expectations does lower the terminal value, but it still seems very high. If anyone can point out where I might have screwed up, please let me know. Let me know if I missed out any info as well.",RF
0,1471037497.0,"Can someone explain this? I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head around it. 

>There is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned portfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or shouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-neutral portfolio? The answer is no. A dollar-neutral portfolio is self financing, meaning the cash you get from selling short pays for the purchase of the long securities, so the financing cost (due to the spread between the credit and debit interest rates) is small and can be neglected for many backtesting purposes. Meanwhile, the mar- gin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the risk-free rate rF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return minus the contribution from the credit interest) is R, and the risk- free rate is rF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe ratio is R + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free rate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to your stock positions.  

>Similarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does not hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the risk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess returns, since you do not have financing costs in this case, either. In general, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy returns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs financing cost.  

________

Edit: I emailed the author and he was kind enough to explain

>Sharpe ratio requires excess return as input. Excess return means raw return minus the funding (interest) cost. For e.g. if you have long $1M IBM, you need to pay interest on that $1M. (Another way to think of this is that your $1M cash could have been generating the same interest if you don't use it for buying IBM.) So the excess return of your $1M IBM is the raw return of IBM minus the interest cost. However, a dollar neutral position is self-financing: the cash earned from the short side is used to purchase the long side. Hence there is no funding cost, and there is no reason to deduct that in computing excess returns. You are generating returns out of thin air, and not incurring any real interest or opportunity cost in holding position. Anyway, with interest rate effectively 0 these days, such distinction hardly matters.

The Volatility smile is the result of the markets assigning a higher volatility to deep in- and deep out of the money FX options. It looks like this:
[Vol Smile](http://i.imgur.com/5nMF8hP.jpg)

It shows that the return distribution assumed by the BSM model (log-normal) does not equal the implied distribution. a figure of this is [here](http://i.imgur.com/DWEzRfA.jpg)

NOW: in the middle of the distribution, there is equal ammount of mass on the right side of the middle both under the lognormal and the implied distribution. Thats the bottom point of the volatility smile, where BSM volatility equals the implied volatility.

At the point K2, the implied distribution has fatter tails, and therefore higher implied volatility, which corresponds to the right side of the first graph, where the implied volatility is higher than the BSM volatility.

I made the point K', where the lognormal distribution should have more mass to the right of K' than the implied distribution. This should result in the implied volatility being LOWER than the BSM volatility. If this is the case why is the volatility smile not more of a W than a smile? like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Lo6tRGg.jpg) (excuse my paint skillz)

please correct my misconceptions.

- figures are from JC.Hull(2011)



**EDIT: Thanks for all the anwsers**
As it turns out, the logic above neglects that events occuring in the tails are weighted heavier than the ones around the mean. this means that extreme values provides more significant price changes, so it is not only the probability of an event occurring at some point but the payoff related to that instance.

I've got a few questions for you:
1) What terminal functions would you like to see built? What are your favorite existing terminal functions you use regularly? What are some functions that don't exist that you'd like to see built?


2) Do you know HTML/JavaScript? If so, feel free to contribute! The documentation is pretty sparse right now but I'll be adding more to it soon.


What I saw in terms of usage of existing financial terminals (i.e. Bloomberg, FactSet, etc.) was that people use their favorite few functions and then basically just export data to Excel/R/Matlab/etc. to run their models. Most of the stuff analysts are doing when they export data is repeatable and I wanted to create an engine that can handle those types of computations and a hub where people could productionalize and collaborate on those custom-built models.

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

Every now and then I compare different stocks to one another, and I often see that unrelated stocks have the same small-scale fluctuations. The noise in the market seems to be highly correlated. For example, compare the Dow to IBM:
https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1338443739571&chddm=25415&chls=IntervalBasedLine&cmpto=NYSE:IBM&cmptdms=0&q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&ntsp=0

or IBM to Intel (this is an edit):
https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1338408000000&chddm=25415&chls=IntervalBasedLine&cmpto=NYSE:IBM;NASDAQ:INTC&cmptdms=0;0&q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&ntsp=0

All of the tiny little spikes in the IBM stock are present in the Dow (or Intel, or a bunch of other stocks), but I don't see how this is possible, or what it means, or why it happens.

Oil investors may regret urging companies to cough up cash now instead of investing in growth for later as the dearth of exploration is setting the stage for an unprecedented crude price spike, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Companies have been compelled to focus on boosting returns and shareholder distributions at the expense of capital expenditures aimed at finding new supplies, analysts including Neil Beveridge wrote in a note Friday. That’s causing reserves at major producers to fall and the industry’s reinvestment ratio to plunge to the lowest in a generation, paving the way for oil prices to surpass records reached last decade, according to Bernstein.

“Investors who had egged on management teams to reign in capex and return cash will lament the underinvestment in the industry,” the analysts wrote. “Any shortfall in supply will result in a super-spike in prices, potentially much larger than the $150 a barrel spike witnessed in 2008.”

The world’s oil majors including [Royal Dutch Shell Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RDSA:NA) and [BP Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BP%2F:LN) navigated the price crash of 2014 by cutting costs, selling assets and taking on debt to help satisfy investors with hefty dividends. The biggest, [Exxon Mobil Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XOM:US), was [punished by shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P5A1YH6VDKHT) earlier this year after compounding disappointing results with a massive spending plan and a lack of buybacks.

The oversupply of crude globally in recent years has masked “chronic underinvestment,” Bernstein said in the report. Oil has rebounded to the highest in more than three years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies started curbing output at the beginning of last year to trim a global glut. The producers aim now to [pump more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-26/opec-supply-buffer-shrinks-as-it-answers-calls-to-pump-more-oil) to help cool the market, but disruptions from Libya to Venezuela are keeping prices elevated.

Proven reserves of the world’s top oil companies have fallen by more than 30 percent on average since 2000, with only Exxon and BP showing an improvement, helped by acquisitions, Bernstein said. Meanwhile, more than 1 billion people will urbanize in Asia over the next two decades and this will drive demand for cars, as well as air travel, road freight and plastics that also require oil, according to Bernstein.

“If oil demand continues to grow to 2030 and beyond, the strategy of returning cash to shareholders and underinvesting in reserves will only turn out to sow the seeds of the next super-cycle,” the analysts wrote. “Companies which have barrels in the ground to produce, or the services to extract them, will be the ones to own and those who do not will be left behind.”

Brent oil rallied to an all-time high above $147 a barrel in 2008 as booming demand growth and a lack of readily available resources fueled a synchronized surge across commodities that was dubbed the super-cycle. The global benchmark was at $76.78 a barrel as of 11:57 a.m. in London on Friday, up about 60 percent in the past year.",SEE

Those that predicted the housing crash of 2008 tended to get the collapse in commodities, gold and silver, and the rally in the US stocks, including tech stocks wrong. The boring /r/investing - type investors that trusted the central bankers and the US government surprisingly did very well.

So, WSB - if you had to make bets for the next 10 years, what would be your predictions and why? I will start, and if you don't have your own ideas you can tell me why mine are completely wrong:

There will be sovereign debt crises among the worlds' ""safest"" debtors, including the US government. This will really fuck things up for institutional investors, because suddently the risk-free rate will turn out to have been very risky.
Why: let's take the US as an example. People have been lending money to the US government at very low rates for 10 years and longer. The US now pays the same amount in interest as in 1980 - for whatever reason people have been OK to lend money to the US government at lower and lower rates despite the US racking up more and more debt instead of repaying it. If the rates go up, the US cannot even pay the interest on the debt - that will freak out the investors and cause the interest rates to go much, much higher, uncontrollably. The only people willing to lend the US money at low rates would be the Federal Reserve. That will lead to the US defaulting on a part of their debt through inflation, destroying much of the value of the USD. This will also make investors worry about other sovereign debt - in Europe, Japan and elsewhere - causing similar problems there as well.

The biggest wildcard is how China will be affected - whether they will let their currency get much stronger relative to the USD (good for China) or not. If relative valuations of currencies stay approx. the same as now, stock indices around the world will not be too much affected in real terms, apart from some short-term shocks, but gold will benefit hugely as governments will rush to exchange their devaluing foreign currency holdings into gold. If China allows its currency to appreciate, then US companies will really suffer (along with US consumers) and US stocks will tank. In fact, stocks around the world will experience a massive shock, but Chinese stocks should come out as the big winner as their companies reorient towards the domestic market.

Bitcoin may do well in the interim as well in case the first-world experiences hyperinflation, and people start actually using bitcoin at the grassroots. But I see a very slim chance of governments around the world letting that happen for long. But there is a slim chance that even though bitcoin is in a bubble right now (people only buying it to sell to the greater fool, not to use it), it may transition out of a bubble without the prices dropping as people actually start using it for day-to-day transactions.

Banks - the conventional wisdom is that rising long-term rates are good for banks. Banks borrow short-term and lend long-term. Short term rates going up are bad for banks, long-term rates going up are good for banks. Currently the spread is uncharacteristically small, which is bad for banks. The assumption is that as the spread increases with the rising rates, banks benefit because the long-term loans they make are adjustable-rate. I think the conventional wisdom will turn out to be wrong, because if long-term rates go up significantly people (who have no savings, plenty of debts and are living paycheck-to-paycheck if they are lucky to have a full-time job) will no longer be able to pay off their long-term debts like mortgages, leading to widespread defaults and losses for banks. So the markets may be too optimistic on banks in a rising-rate environment and in the next 10 years, it may be a good idea to short banks relative to the market. In the inflation scenario I described in point 1 you get people effectively defaulting on their loans through inflation, so that's bad for banks as well. This is a tough trade though, because banks will go up all the way until something gives - either the governments can't pay their debts, or the general public. Gold, however, doesn't have much lower to go, everyone already hates it (even WSB), making it a safer trade than shorting banks.
I don't see any way in which this scenario doesn't play out, and I would be really surprised if it doesn't play out in the next 10 years.",SEE

If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist if you read the articles.

I originally wrote this as a facebook post for my friends. Please excuse the entry-level explanations, we all know how the bond market works here, but I'm at work and don't really have time to modify it right now. This was also written last Thursday, treasuries have moved even higher still since then.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982. The Reagan Administration, in their ever-prescient wisdom, enacted SEC Rule 10b-18, creating a safe harbor whereby corporations could buy back their own stocks. This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

7:00AM - Arrive to work and head to our morning meeting.  I will typically provide a short re-cap of the developments in my market. There are other speakers as well.  New York, Montreal and London are tuned in via video conference.  Few people are really engaged or paying attention. 

8AM - Drink one small coffee.  Start reading market news, commentary; look at US futures markets, overseas markets and what the bond market is doing to try and get a sense of market tone.

8:30Am - Start working on my morning ""runs"" - a list of various stocks and prices where I am willing to buy and sell/short out of my liability/prop inventory account.  Send that list to all my clients via email along with some daily market commentary.

9:00AM - Start chit-chatting with a few clients on phone and IM because this job is all about relationships. Monitor changes in the market pre-open.  Make sure all my client orders and algos are set up properly for the open.

9:30AM - Market open.  Trades start trickling in to my trade management system - some for client, some for inventory.

10:00AM - I read emails from my backoffice desk telling me certain trades from yesterday are failing to settle with clients.  I follow up with the clients to figure out where the discrepancy is (client usually typed in the wrong price, or wrong quantity or forgot to tell their custodian).

10:30 AM - Get asked by the intern what I want to eat for lunch. I pick something and give him $10. I thank him every time because I feel bad for him.  

11:00 AM - I scour the market for mis-priced securities. I buy cheap and sell expensive.  Call clients.  Leverage trust and relationships to obtain information - what are they trying to buy, what are they trying to sell?  Do I want to be the counter party to their trade? Does it make sense - Is it cheap or expensive?  Trade some stock. 

12:00 AM - Lunch arrives.  I thank the intern again. Eat lunch at my desk. I can never leave my desk.  

12:30 - 4pm - Same thing as @ 11AM.  Negotiate prices with clients and trade blocks.  Read reddit for a bit.  Look at some cars for sale on autotrader.  Trade more stock.  Plan a lunch meeting or drinks after work with a client next week and make reservations.

4:00PM - Market close.  I organize the days trades into various accounts and make sure all my inventory and client trades are pushed to the right accounts. Send out emails and IM to clients advising them on quantity, price, stock symbol and commission and sometimes CC my backoffice.  Client tries to pressure me into paying us 3 cents per share instead of the usual 4. I give in.

4:10PM - On my calculator I do some rough calculation to get an idea of the revenue from client commissions that day.  On good days I feel neutral, on bad days I feel worhless because I have been conditioned to feel like that by the culture here.

4:15PM - I get a call from my backoffice guy advising me how much my inventory is up or down (daily mark-to-market).  I send an email to management so they can see it if they care to.

4:30pm - I leave work

5:00pm - Arrive home.  Go to sleep for one hour because I am completely drained mentally.

Happy Dow 21,000!

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 300 points to top 21,000 for the first time"" yesterday, and did you know that the Dow has closed at an all-time high 41 times in the last 12 months? That's about one out of every six trading days. And it's 15 times in 2017 so far, or almost twice a week. New Dow all-time highs are now less noteworthy than Tuesdays. Of course only five of the last year's closes crossed new 1,000-point thresholds (17,000 through 21,000), but still: five. Are you getting a little bored of celebrating new Dow milestones? Are you ... I am sorry ... tired of winning? Anyway here is a story about how 1,000 is 5 percent of 20,000 but 10 percent of 10,000, which is another reason to be bored I guess. We should pick an arbitrary starting point and then celebrate each subsequent 10 percent increase, or just start reporting the log of the Dow rather than the level.",NOW

0,1566048606.0,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",NOW
0,1446154605.0,"Hello all, 

I'm currently sponsored under AXA. I passed my S7 and while I know it's barely touches the basics and the surface of the field, I have a particular plea for help. Considering I come from a college background of philosophy, I know there's a lot more for me to learn about how to watch the market and become capable of making valid recommendations for clients. My mentor has mentioned that the majority of the learning will come from the field experience, which I'm sure is true. However, I'm curious how I can get myself started with learning how to become really familiar with the trends in the market and learn how to understand it like the back of my hand.

My question is: what do really experienced market-watchers and investment advisors do as far as a daily routine is concerned? I read the WSJ and I've been recommended the book, ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"". In summation, on a broader level, what do you guys do to evaluate all this constantly fluctuating data on a daily basis to make sound decisions on where to invest for yourself and for clients?

I'm aware there's no sure fire way to be certain about where to invest. I'm more interested in the regimens of experienced pros that they conduct on a daily basis to help create a clearer decision making picture.  ",NOW

But it's not clear to me whether this phenomenon is the result of people using Black-Scholes and essentially just plugging in higher IVs at lower strikes according to some formula, or if people are just using completely different models now, which just happen to appear as a volatility smile when viewed through the lens of Black-Scholes. Is there an accepted standard here?

I guess what I'm looking for is someone to point me in the direction of some resources that either (a) expand on alternative models to Black-Scholes that don't assume normal returns (preferably models that are actually used in practice) or (b) explain how Black-Scholes is actually used in the real world without assuming the distribution of returns on the underlying is normal.

And in a similar vein, I would be really appreciative of any resources/research/papers exploring distributions that more accurately describe market returns compared to the normal distribution.

A lot of redditors joined the course and there were huge spikes in enrollment whenever I posted announcements on reddit.

I just wanted to say thanks to the mods for allowing me to advertise the course and to all redditors who joined. If you missed out on this opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Excel VBA programming, the course will be reoffered as a free self-paced course in early August (hopefully by August 7, but it will depend on a few factors). At that time, you will be able to [access the course here](https://openeducation.blackboard.com/mooc-catalog/courseDetails/view?course_id=_219_1). The course will remain up and running for the foreseeable future.

Here is a link to the [videos used in the course](https://youtu.be/fZU4RdvoPxg?list=PLZOZfX_TaWAGg2uE_E7fz5SCrHhMaKw8j).

Enjoy!

There have also been talks about ringfencing divisions, banning proprietary trading, and so forth. Still, all the articles I have read have only painted a very vague picture of what is going on. Which regulatory bodies are involved specifically in terms of legislating and enforcing the rules? Is it the EC, the ECB, the European Banking Authority? What about the stress tests? What penalties did the banks that did not meet the tests face, if any? Same thing with the Liikanen report--did it serve any purpose besides issuing recommendations? Are the new rules all mandatory, or are they all voluntary, like Basel III. If Basel III is voluntary, why do banks bother to follow it? And about banning proprietary trading, don't bank with US operations automatically have to comply already? If so, will banning prop trading have any impact on large global banks at all?

So many questions... I'd really appreciate your help with any of them. I've searched everywhere and cannot find answers.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",SO

I currently work at a hedge fund and have had the pleasure of interacting with a bunch of former ""star"" bank traders. One thing I've noticed about them on the buy side is that they never normally live up to the hype - which I've heard is fairly common phenomenon. Perhaps consider this mean-reversion. I tend to be a believer in a weak-to-semi-strong EMH and discount their skill anyway, but I'm more curious as to how on aggregate banks made out like bandits for their own books in the last 2 decades..

I guess my hangup is that I don't see what they bring to the table as competitive advantages. They trade with each other, using the same information base and often the same traders (who move from bank to bank). I see no reason to believe that a trader at an investment bank has any special insight into the future, based on what we get to read from the copious amounts of research that the research teams at these firms put out anyway...

I've had a few chats with traders who worked at places like Lehman in the late 90s/early 00s and they openly admitted to things like front-running clients, breaking exchange rules, snooping on client data pipes etc. but I'm skeptical even that activity can explain the eye-popping amounts of cash these firms turned over.

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to?

0,1349188198.0,"So here's a simplified version of what I understand as Enterprise Value:

EV = Mkt. Cap + Debt - Cash

(Of course, ""market cap"" would also include value of preferred shares, ""debt"" would include all obligations and liabilities, and ""cash"" all cash-equivalent holdings.) 

Now here's my question. Imagine a company that has 0 debt. As that company's amount of cash on hand increases relative to its market cap, its enterprise value would seem to approach zero. In other words, to use an implausible hypothetical, if there was a company that had zero debt and had somehow accumulated cash equivalent to its market cap, then its enterprise value would be 0. But a company with no debt and lots of cash should be worth *more* because of those factors, shouldn't it?

I see why debt and liabilities must be added in the formula, since you're taking on those burdens if you buy the whole enterprise. And I see why it would make sense to subtract cash from debt, to mitigate that added responsibility. But when cash > debt, I don't see why you still subtract cash. 

Wikipedia seems to say that it's because you'd have to pay out that cash as a dividend to the people whose shares you're buying. But why would you? Or is it that you subtract the cash from the ""market cap"" price tag because you could use the cash to buy the equity? But still, what happens in the admittedly outlandish scenario where cash = market cap or cash > market cap? Can a company have an EV of 0 or negative something?

**More broadly, what does enterprise value mean in relation to market cap?** I know EV is meant to indicate the value of the whole company. At first, I thought that meant that a company with a market cap higher than its EV is overvalued on the market. Is that right? Or am I just not understanding what EV is for?

Currently TSLA has a market capitalization of $20B which isn't a huge number when you compare it to big players in the market such as GM, Honda or Ford which have $50B, $72B, $70B in respect but it is still a very huge number for a company who didn't made profit yet. And this number is an especially big number for a company that made $385M revenue in 2012 since this company also lost $396M.

I know making loses is part of the R&D process and tsla might start the reap the fruits of the money spent on R&D with its new products. Lets be over optimistic and say that they will be making 100x more money than they used to by next year this time and will generate a revenue of $40B. $110B shy from GM's revenue in year 2012. And also in order to generate this revenue they would have to sell 363,000 cars(based on model s85p price of 110). Which is highly unlikely considering tesla was planning to create 800 model s's by late 2014. 

This is why I wouldn't buy tsla at its current price point. I think they have a great idea, a great business plan and they might have great products, but they're too expensive to be a sound investment. 

**Fun fact:** Ellon Musk has 5 million something stock options in his company. Although I don't know their price points I would say they are pretty low considering they were isssued in 2012

How quickly can the ETF holdings get back in sync with the index? Would the issuer start redeeming shares with a basket containing *only* `NKE`, and issuing shares for baskets that contain *only* `TSLA`? During this transition, can the ETF unit price deviate substantially from the index itself?

0,1386804473.0,"Though the real story is somewhat less fanciful, these parables are said to be transcribed from a set of stone carvings from the ancient city of Babylon. After being translated, it provides a glimpse of how personal finances were managed by the rich of the old world, and their advice to others on how to gain financial independence. In them, a rich man describes how to become rich to a poor man, a slave buys himself independence, and the sale of goats is discussed to great length. 

It is, in my humble opinion, one of the most important books you'll ever read. I don't say this often, but this book changed my life, and I think it can change yours. 

It is the bible of finance, and describes so perfectly the finances of those in a dead nation that it manages to make the practice of finance into a science, complete with it's own laws and theories, whether you're dealing with gold coins, goats, or dollars and cents.

I was looking through different maturities of Ace and Travelers today and I noticed that the 2043s trade tight to the 2036s. I'm curious as to what is causing that. I think it is because of a liquidity premium being assessed to the 2036s. Indeed, they do trade far less often than the 2043s.

0,1422847406.0,"I am trying to figure out a way to identify the leading contributors to the performance of multiple securities. For example, one idea I had was to run a multivariate regression using the securities returns as dependent variables and include things like oil, the dollar, the euro, treasury yields, etc.

E.g.,

SBUX + AAPL + MCD + BAC + TWTR = intercept + oil + dollar + euro + steel + gold + e

Would that be a correct way of seeing which variables are significant contributors to each of the stocks' performance?

Would Principal Component Analysis be a way of achieving the same end? A better way than multivariate regression? Is there another method suited to find these common contributors?

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

2006-2008 I played poker for a living, made ~90k during that time.. about 50k in cash at casinos and 40 online which went through my bank account

late 2008 until now I have been freelancing, made about 15k on the books and 15 off, most of the off-the-books were local checks I cashed that never touched my bank account (which is in another state if that matters).

I also have about 5k in credit card debt.

One of which being, it is ridiculous to me to think that one analyst could 'figure out' some VaR models that indicate the party was over, before anyone else on the street had any idea there was something wrong. 

Another is, from my understanding, one of the problems with the securities these banks held was they were very illiquid. As such, is it even possible to trade one of these securities over the line in ~5 min? Or is there more detailed analysis that needs to take place that would increase the time necessary to complete each transaction?

0,1298740228.0,"I'm an undergraduate, looking to go into trading/research. I've joined a trading simulator game that can potentially land interviews at banks if it goes well.

This is my first time trading anything. We have a choice of 17 different futures (gold, copper, wheat, S&P500, FTSE, currencies etc). So far my success has been a mixed bag: my first large position (long on copper last week) went bad, but I have nullified this with a successful long on oil this week.

I'm looking for tips on how to play. I have a few specific questions:

*  How do you decide where to place stop losses? Often I will take a position, the market moves against me a bit, my stop loss triggers and then the market moves in the direction I bet. Obviously, setting too loose a stop loss isn't a good idea. Where's the balance?

* How do you decide when to take profits? I could've made 3MM USD off my oil position had I closed out at the top of the market, but instead I waited for it to go up sooner. After it became clear that it wasn't going to, I closed out my position for a profit of 2MM.

* Where do you get news from? I'm reading the FT, Bloomberg, and ZeroHedge. However, all the news I get is post-hoc and the market has already moved with this information. Where would one go to get up-to-date news on copper, for example?

* Edit: bonus question. What is a reasonable balance of the amount of risk and the time you take that risk on for? The simulator comes with a guide that has a fairly detailed analysis of previous winners. They found that the winners used large amount of VaR (~99%) for short periods of time (30 seconds - 1 hour). However, there was no analysis of the losers - I feel that losers might have employed the same strategy but just not ""lucked out"" with the market movements. So far I have been employing ~25% to ~50% VaR for a period of between half an hour and two days, but I am far from the most successful competitor.

I'm happy to answer any questions about the simulator. It runs on a VaR system - max of 3MM. It has a week and a half left to run.",VAR
0,1428031121.0,"Hey... Throwaway account obviously.  Curious about any educated thoughts on distressed whole loan trading funds?  

I actually have an interview coming up with a well established fund (several billion AUM, >20 year track record) in their whole loan trading group but I've never had that much exposure to RE let alone whole loans.  

For background, I'm an associate in trading at bulge bracket.  Been here for 4 years and focus on cross-product portfolio trading (generally speaking I work with a lot of your vanilla products: equity, both listed and otc eq options, corp and conv debt though only limited amounts in the distressed or structured facility space, and a bit with cds and var swaps generally with respect to risk/hedging).

Questions I had were:

- I see most white papers out there are usually by funds talking about the huge amount of distressed whole loans still on balance sheets, does this indicate despite where we are in the credit cycle there is still ample room for these funds to find value?

- The fund high level model focuses on picking up distressed whole loans, service to performing, and securitization for offloading.  Is this the standard approach these PE funds take?

- From what I understand, lending banks generally package bundles of whole loans for clusters of sales in which there's a multi-day bidding process.  Can anyone shed further light on the details of this process?

- What kind of implications can a sustained rising interest rate environment have on these funds?  The fund has a quant desk focused on managing IR risk through what I assume are OTC IRS's, but on the loan market as a whole do periods of higher default rates (usually associated with rising interest rates) negatively impact performance of these funds?

I know this is a lot of questions for a very niche market, but just hoping someone might deal in the space.

0,1566048606.0,"Hello Fam, I'm noticing a lot of information and misinformation on yield curve inversion of US Treasury curve so I thought we should all do a quick exercise together to best understand how it all works.

Basic assumptions/role of a bank:

1. Member banks of the Fed have the ability to create and destroy money (fractional reserve banking)
2. Member banks mainly fund short term overnight deposits and lend long (maturity transformation)
3. Member banks mainly understand 'credit' and lend to 'risky' ventures (risk transformation)

Now pretend you're one of our national banking franchise like good 'ole BoA with a $2.4tn balance sheet (review pages 7 and 8 from the link below)

[http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/static-files/ae6b78d9-f265-4c10-8c53-06ff395dd9ae)

BoA has $270bn of shareholder's equity and with that it starts creating assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) simultaneously in a way to fulfill its role as a member bank (read more about fractional reserve banking:  [https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy)).

Furthermore, it sets a rate of interest on its 'risky' longer term asset which it believes will be fair relative to all other opportunities available in the market to compensate the bank for the uncertainty of the venture it's loaned money to.

And it sets a rate of interest in pays on the deposit which it deems to be fair relative to the market opportunity of 'savings' for those who do not want to do the work of understanding 'risk' but still want to participate in some upside.

Simply said, the bank's expertise is credit + maturity transformation, so it creates assets (issued at a higher interest rate) and liabilities (issued at a lower interest rate) and the margin (NIM) is to compensate it for the effort it goes through to match assets and liabilities.

Now here comes the FED and the YIELD CURVE. Through the necessity to control this magic of fractional reserve banking/risk/maturity transformation there are rules in place so banks don't go out and willy nilly create assets and liabilities irresponsibly (INFLATION). One way the FED controls its member banks is to control SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. The FED does this by controlling a magic substance called 'reserves'. 'Reserves' are what the member banks must hold relative to the total size of their assets/liabilities that they create (read Bank of England link above for a better explanation).

The FED as the creator and destroyer of 'reserves' so in the end the FED can control how much total assets and liabilities are created. The FED does this by buying and selling reserves and also just telling people where it wants the rate so the member banks don't fight it (they can if they want, but the FED always wins because it only has the magical power to create and destroy 'reserves').

Now the YIELD CURVE. Generally speaking, you can only create an asset based on our expectation of the future. If you were to start a farm, you have an idea of how much YIELD your farm will grow next year, and if you're really good at farming you can forecast how much potential your farm has in the future. Similarly, well run businesses have a good understanding of how well they'll do in the next 2 years and some projects they'll know the performance for the next 10 or 30 years, and so will their bankers because they'll create liabilities to fund it! This is your YIELD CURVE.

Now remember the FED controls the short term interest rates, and member banks use this benchmark and lend out longer and riskier. The FED strives to make sure the curve is generally speaking upward sloping so that the normal function of banking happens where bankers can borrow short and lower rates and lend longer and riskier, but not too much! So it strives to increase the short term rate when the banks start creating too many assets/liabilities and lowers it when it can't create enough assets/liabilities.

When the YIELD CURVE starts to invert, Mr. Market is telling the FED our future expectation of economic YIELD is dropping. We do not think it's possible for us to actually create assets/liabilities that are higher than the short term interest rate that you set!

This is why the inverted YIELD CURVE is an indicator of possibility of recession. The banks are signaling to the FED that economic headwinds will not allow us to create assets/liabilities at the higher interest rates we expected. The FED's short term interest rates now are TOO DAMN HIGH. The FED is always slow to move and the recession is almost always soon to follow. Remember, the FED isn't trying to be an asshole. They're not keeping short term interest rates TOO DAMN HIGH for fun. Something happened SUDDENLY in the last 2-3 months that made banks think our current paradigm of thinking is wrong.

HOW SOON will we recess? That totally depends on which asset/liabilities are driving the decrease of longer term interest rates relative to short term. Also remember, it's a set of assets/liabilities which recess, sometimes they're interlinked with the whole economy, sometimes they're not. Which asset/liability mixture is to blame? That's far too complex to explain here and what people get a paid a lot of ""money"" to understand.",WELL

0,1309816812.0,"This question is based off the idea of looking at the past three-decade long trend in America where if you look at any considerable period of time (say 10 years) you'll note that, *on net*, government spending is financed by their ability to take on more debt. It is accurate to say that they’ve been *rolling over* their bills over that entire period of time and haven’t actually been paying them… they’re only deferring the actual payment.
The significance of that reality is that it means that their people are consistently not actually paying for all the goods and services that their government provides each year. In other words, the government is not taxing away $X from its people at the beginning of a spending period in order to pay for the $X of spending it wishes to engage in for that period. Is that not an incredibly significant thing to be aware of?
I'm beginning to wonder if much of the first world's love affair with central planning and large amounts of government intervention and involvement in their economies has a lot to do with them thinking that government is ""better than it really costs"" because government is on-net truly giving more wealth to the people than it is taking away from them? To be absolutely clear, it's only doing that in the *short term*, as eventually the full bill will have to be paid, but I wonder if those who are only living in the part where they're on net spending more then they're being taxed end up being somewhat deluded or tricked into thinking it's a “more magical” arrangement than it really is?
To be clear on what I'm saying:
What if instead of government spending $100 in a year and taxing the people $10 per year over the next 35 years instead taxed the people $100 at the end of that spending year? Would the people then think something like, ""Wow, we are actually paying so much more for our government to perform these goods and services for us"" (in this example you'd be paying 10x the tax bill in the year)? Do you think that would lead to a very different outlook by the masses on what level of their wealth they’d like taxed from them each year to be allocated by government?
This is the idea that the question in my opening title was getting at. That if the West were no longer able to defer paying for their government then there would be a period where they'd have to be paying a *higher tax bill* and yet be getting the *exact same level of goods and services* from their government.
Lastly, is it not only fair to judge the effectiveness of our governments around the world once they've paid back all their debts on net? Otherwise are we not sort of making an apples-to-oranges comparison in our analysis? I mean, if you can judge my ""economic effectiveness"" after I take out a large loan, then buy really cool stuff, yet *still have lots of debt outstanding*, then is it really fair to analyze me at that very moment in time and conclude something like, ""Yep, you're awesome because before you had not much and now you have lots of stuff!"" To me at least, it only makes sense to judge the effectiveness *after I've retired all the debt* and *then* assess whether I have more or less stuff.
Does anyone think that due to man being capable of being greedy it doesn't make much sense to allow humans to take from ""society's collective wealth"" and live their entire lives in a period where they're getting more from their government then they're paying for (being taxed)?
I ask just because to me it seems like a far more intelligent arrangement to **tax all the wealth from the people each year that you wish to spend**! Doesn't that create a far better incentive scheme? Why would that be bad or unreasonable? Wouldn’t such an arrangement be far more resilient to economic shocks? Why should we ""hide"" the costs of our government? Why not structure things such that we are reminded each and every single year exactly what it is that we are giving up in order to get the goods and services we're asking for of our government? Is it really so unreasonable to tax all of that which you wish to spend and do so at the end of each period?
I see a very big difference in allowing an *individual* to defer his payments on things than I do in allowing a *government* to defer its payments on things because at least in the former case it is *that individual* who will have to pay for all the interest. Perhaps it’s worth it to him to get to enjoy that higher standard of living *now*. Perhaps it’s not. Regardless, it is for *him* to decide. This is in sharp contrast to allowing a government to defer its payments because it is entirely possible that you’ll end up having a *later generation* paying for all the interest that accrued from a *previous generation* choosing to defer payment until later.
Thoughts? Am I the only one who thinks it’s better for government to pay for itself over a much shorter time period, like say a year, in order to prevent very bad incentives from forming?

These are the terms I often see floating around forums and blogs. So I turn to reddit. I'd like the following concepts explained thoroughly, yet clear enough for a college freshman to understand:

1) Discounted Cash Flow model/analysis

2) Black-Scholes model/formula

""The ordinary way that an initial public offering works is that the company’s executives fly around the world meeting with investors and trying to convince them to invest. This tends to be stressful and exhausting for the executives, and there is no guarantee that it will work; the investors might be skeptical and refuse to invest, or invest at a lower valuation than the executives want. If you gave the executives the option of, instead, kidnapping all of the potential investors, bringing them to a central location, and torturing them until they agreed to buy shares at a generous valuation, some executives might choose the kidnap-and-torture option. This option is not, however, generally presented in pitchbooks, because it is not generally an option. Do not kidnap and torture investors! Bad!

Oil investors may regret urging companies to cough up cash now instead of investing in growth for later as the dearth of exploration is setting the stage for an unprecedented crude price spike, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Companies have been compelled to focus on boosting returns and shareholder distributions at the expense of capital expenditures aimed at finding new supplies, analysts including Neil Beveridge wrote in a note Friday. That’s causing reserves at major producers to fall and the industry’s reinvestment ratio to plunge to the lowest in a generation, paving the way for oil prices to surpass records reached last decade, according to Bernstein.

“Investors who had egged on management teams to reign in capex and return cash will lament the underinvestment in the industry,” the analysts wrote. “Any shortfall in supply will result in a super-spike in prices, potentially much larger than the $150 a barrel spike witnessed in 2008.”

The world’s oil majors including [Royal Dutch Shell Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RDSA:NA) and [BP Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BP%2F:LN) navigated the price crash of 2014 by cutting costs, selling assets and taking on debt to help satisfy investors with hefty dividends. The biggest, [Exxon Mobil Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XOM:US), was [punished by shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P5A1YH6VDKHT) earlier this year after compounding disappointing results with a massive spending plan and a lack of buybacks.

The oversupply of crude globally in recent years has masked “chronic underinvestment,” Bernstein said in the report. Oil has rebounded to the highest in more than three years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies started curbing output at the beginning of last year to trim a global glut. The producers aim now to [pump more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-26/opec-supply-buffer-shrinks-as-it-answers-calls-to-pump-more-oil) to help cool the market, but disruptions from Libya to Venezuela are keeping prices elevated.

Proven reserves of the world’s top oil companies have fallen by more than 30 percent on average since 2000, with only Exxon and BP showing an improvement, helped by acquisitions, Bernstein said. Meanwhile, more than 1 billion people will urbanize in Asia over the next two decades and this will drive demand for cars, as well as air travel, road freight and plastics that also require oil, according to Bernstein.

“If oil demand continues to grow to 2030 and beyond, the strategy of returning cash to shareholders and underinvesting in reserves will only turn out to sow the seeds of the next super-cycle,” the analysts wrote. “Companies which have barrels in the ground to produce, or the services to extract them, will be the ones to own and those who do not will be left behind.”

Brent oil rallied to an all-time high above $147 a barrel in 2008 as booming demand growth and a lack of readily available resources fueled a synchronized surge across commodities that was dubbed the super-cycle. The global benchmark was at $76.78 a barrel as of 11:57 a.m. in London on Friday, up about 60 percent in the past year.",WELL

0,1510091507.0,"It seems that most people got the previous 10 years wrong. Those that predicted the housing crash of 2008 tended to get the collapse in commodities, gold and silver, and the rally in the US stocks, including tech stocks wrong. The boring /r/investing - type investors that trusted the central bankers and the US government surprisingly did very well.

So, WSB - if you had to make bets for the next 10 years, what would be your predictions and why? I will start, and if you don't have your own ideas you can tell me why mine are completely wrong:

There will be sovereign debt crises among the worlds' ""safest"" debtors, including the US government. This will really fuck things up for institutional investors, because suddently the risk-free rate will turn out to have been very risky.
Why: let's take the US as an example. People have been lending money to the US government at very low rates for 10 years and longer. The US now pays the same amount in interest as in 1980 - for whatever reason people have been OK to lend money to the US government at lower and lower rates despite the US racking up more and more debt instead of repaying it. If the rates go up, the US cannot even pay the interest on the debt - that will freak out the investors and cause the interest rates to go much, much higher, uncontrollably. The only people willing to lend the US money at low rates would be the Federal Reserve. That will lead to the US defaulting on a part of their debt through inflation, destroying much of the value of the USD. This will also make investors worry about other sovereign debt - in Europe, Japan and elsewhere - causing similar problems there as well.

The biggest wildcard is how China will be affected - whether they will let their currency get much stronger relative to the USD (good for China) or not. If relative valuations of currencies stay approx. the same as now, stock indices around the world will not be too much affected in real terms, apart from some short-term shocks, but gold will benefit hugely as governments will rush to exchange their devaluing foreign currency holdings into gold. If China allows its currency to appreciate, then US companies will really suffer (along with US consumers) and US stocks will tank. In fact, stocks around the world will experience a massive shock, but Chinese stocks should come out as the big winner as their companies reorient towards the domestic market.

Bitcoin may do well in the interim as well in case the first-world experiences hyperinflation, and people start actually using bitcoin at the grassroots. But I see a very slim chance of governments around the world letting that happen for long. But there is a slim chance that even though bitcoin is in a bubble right now (people only buying it to sell to the greater fool, not to use it), it may transition out of a bubble without the prices dropping as people actually start using it for day-to-day transactions.

Banks - the conventional wisdom is that rising long-term rates are good for banks. Banks borrow short-term and lend long-term. Short term rates going up are bad for banks, long-term rates going up are good for banks. Currently the spread is uncharacteristically small, which is bad for banks. The assumption is that as the spread increases with the rising rates, banks benefit because the long-term loans they make are adjustable-rate. I think the conventional wisdom will turn out to be wrong, because if long-term rates go up significantly people (who have no savings, plenty of debts and are living paycheck-to-paycheck if they are lucky to have a full-time job) will no longer be able to pay off their long-term debts like mortgages, leading to widespread defaults and losses for banks. So the markets may be too optimistic on banks in a rising-rate environment and in the next 10 years, it may be a good idea to short banks relative to the market. In the inflation scenario I described in point 1 you get people effectively defaulting on their loans through inflation, so that's bad for banks as well. This is a tough trade though, because banks will go up all the way until something gives - either the governments can't pay their debts, or the general public. Gold, however, doesn't have much lower to go, everyone already hates it (even WSB), making it a safer trade than shorting banks.
I don't see any way in which this scenario doesn't play out, and I would be really surprised if it doesn't play out in the next 10 years.",WELL

If you've been here a while, I'm sure you've seen someone ask a variation of ""I've got an interview at XXXX tomorrow, what should I know in Excel or something along those lines. There are a few threads (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/25k6tn/what_are_some_useful_tricks_shortcuts_and/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1c0z0h/excel_modeling_for_corporate_finance/) which have a bunch of great tips but as far as I know there is no one post, so this is my attempt to create one.

**Introduction**

If you are a complete beginner, I recommend downloading [this spreadsheet](http://www.hoffits.com) to familiarize yourself with the basic functions. 

*General Tips:* (many of these are from /u/kentaloupe, thank you)

* Do not use the mouse. Unplug it, and learn all the shortcuts. It will make your life so much easier in the long run. Here are finance specific shortcuts for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf). (PDF files) Print one off, and use it until you don't need it anymore. I can't stress this point enough. Seriously unplug your mouse and learn how to properly use the program.
* Have a mac? Good for you, so do I. It's awesome at almost everything, including running windows. So go get a copy of windows, and run excel on that. Excel for mac is not good for finance. 
* Avoid hardcoding values. It makes your work messy and difficult to audit and edit. If you have to hardcode, make the text blue.
* On the subject of text colors, *green* is for references to other *sheets* and *black* is for *formulas*. After that, it varies from place to place, but these are standard.
* Comment on your work. It’ll make it make a ton more sense to everyone who uses your file. (Note: some people like to comment using SHIFT-F2 while others prefer comments in the margins. It depends on where you work/who you work for)
* Name your cells and ranges. It’ll help you out a ton in the long run. (Note: you don’t need to name every cell or range, but it’s very helpful to name cells that hold a hardcoded variable such as a tax rate)
* Many analysts will remove or disable the caps lock and F1 keys. A paperclip under the key does the same thing, and doesn’t look as ugly as tearing them out. There are a bunch of programs to disable keyboard keys available, I use [this](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com) one. You can also disable the F1 key with a VBA macro, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl44x7) thanks to /u/tally_in_da_house.
* Check you file with print preview before delivering it to make sure it looks okay. Setting the print area also works but it will slow down larger files.
* On the subject of looking pretty, learn conditional formatting then remember to only use it for final copies/deliverables. It makes files unbearably slow if you have a lot of data.

**Shortcuts**

* Seriously, even if you’re an expert, take a look at the shortcuts on these sheets here, you might find something new. (sheets for Excel [2013](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2013_shortcuts.pdf), [2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2010_shortcuts.pdf), and [2007](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wsp_sample_file/excel_2007_shortcuts.pdf).)
* *ALT:* hitting alt will label everything in the ribbon with a letter, which you can hit to do that shortcut. For example:
* *ALT-E-S:* This opens up the advanced paste window. Look at all the options and hit the underlined letter to select whichever one you want. Eg. *ALT-E-S-T-Enter* is paste format, *ALT-E-S-V-Enter* is paste values.
* *F2* and *esc* to quickly audit cells. (thanks again /u/kentaloupe)
* *Ctrl-Shift-[:* Follows where a formula links to. (Brings you to the referenced cell, great for auditing) Thanks /u/publicfinance
* *F4:* switch between absolute and relative cell references 
* *Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn:* Switch tabs (credit to /u/throw-it-out for this and the next 8)
* *Alt+PgUp/PgDn:* Page Left/Right
* *Alt+O,D,A:* Conditional formatting
* *Alt+O,C,A:* Fit column width to contents
* *Ctrl+~:* Show formulas in cells instead of values
* *Ctrl+1:* Show format cell dialog
* *Ctrl+; :* Enter current date in cell
* *Ctrl+:* - Enter current time in cell
* *Ctrl+Shift+ +:* Insert Row/Column/Cell(s) (Not working? See [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/cpl20gx) by /u/Levils)
* *Alt+Shift+F1:* Insert new worksheet

**Key Formulas**

* *index/match*: like vlookup and hlookup but more powerful, and anecdotally quicker. Learn vlookup first and then learn index/match and never switch back. 
* *sum/offset:* find totals for dynamic ranges of data. Good for calculations based on a changing range of data
* *and/or:* can be used in conjunction with other formulas, lets you have multiple requirements or optional requirements in your formulas.
* *sumif, sumifs, countif, countifs:* all either add or count a row based on one or more conditions. These are pretty easy to learn.
* *sumproduct:* Exactly like it sounds, gives you the sum of the product of 2 rows/columns. [Sumproduct can also be used as enhanced version of SUMIF/SUMIFS, etc., since the way those functions handle booleans is atrocious. E.g. =SUMPRODUCT(--(A:A>0), --NOT(ISBLANK(B:B)), C:C)] (thanks /u/tf113)
* *address and indirect:* I hate these, you can google them. They’re very useful and very volatile. Often seen with index/match and can often be replaced by an index/index/match. (Thanks /u/tjen)

There are a ton of other great formulas out there, these are just some of the most commonly used ones in finance. If I’m missing anything, PM me or leave a comment and I’ll add it in.

**Other**

* *Add-ins:* Not really an add-in, but turn on the developer tab right away. It gives you access to VBA which is incredibly powerful. While you’re there, turn on “Solver” as well, you’ll thank me later. 

* As far as finance specific add-ins, I use [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com/macros) (the free version) which has a bunch of functions I use all the time. The paid version is good too, and if you need the functionality, it’s 100% worth it. The site also has DCF, LBO, M&A and Cap table models which are pretty good to learn from. I don’t like the format, but they’re well build and designed. 

* *VBA*: VBA deserves it's own separate post, so I won't cover it here. ""Power Programming with Excel VBA"" comes recommended by /u/tf113 for those who want to take your skills to the next level.

* *Pivot Tables:* These didn’t really fit anywhere else, so I put them here. They are one of the most powerful and underused features in excel. They can be used to summarize almost any data. My associate taught me how to create financial statements from GL data using pivot tables which is incredible for doing valuation work as it lets you see a breakdown of every transaction that affects whichever account you use. (This makes normalizing EBITDA/EBIT  a *ton* easier, and this is just one case.) ([Guide for this process can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/comments/2zqivs/turn_gl_data_dumps_into_dynamic_detailed/))

* *Templates:* [This](http://www.exinfm.com/free_spreadsheets.html) is a great resource with a bunch of finance specific templates. [Macabacus](https://www.macabacus.com) also has a few free templates which I mentioned before.

This is a work in progress, so feedback and comments are appreciated! I’d love to make this a community resource that we could direct people to to get started with excel for finance.

It is important to begin this breakdown with the notion that the stock market as you know it has been fraudulently inflated since 1982.

This effectively legalized price manipulation, but worry not! They set a limit on the amount of money these firms could spend… at 25% of the average daily trading volume PER DAY. This rule overrode the anti-fraud measures enacted in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and set the market off on the 34-year bull run that people love to cite when they say that the market is “doing just fine.” The chairwoman of the SEC has admitted that they aren’t even monitoring this rule, but that is beside the point, as it is a ridiculous rule to begin with. Long story short, the record setting DJIA quotes that we constantly see are no more than a product of price manipulation and financial engineering.

Here are a few facts:

1) Stock buybacks have accounted for a little over one fifth of the buildup of S&P 500 market capitalization since the 2009 crash. ([source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-stock-buybacks-have-become-wall-streets-new-drug-2015-07-17))

2) In 2015Q1, firms’ shareholder cash distributions (buybacks + dividend payments) exceeded their net income for the first time in a non-recession year EVER. ([source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-26/s-p-500-spending-on-buybacks-dividends-exceeds-operating-profit))

3) While companies are sitting on record-setting cash piles, they have been issuing bonds to borrow money to finance these distributions, since they cannot repatriate the money they have hidden in offshore tax havens. ([source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/30/with-all-of-apples-cash-why-is-it-issuing-bonds/))

It is that third point where President-Elect Donald J. Trump becomes relevant. His proposed tax plan would create a $6.2 trillion budget shortfall over the first ten years it was enacted according to the Tax Policy Center ([source](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-revised-tax-plan)). To cover this shortfall, as the government does when public revenues do not meet public expenditures, there will need to be a bond issuance and increase in national debt. This is just the baseline, and does not account for increases in expenditure to repair infrastructure as he spoke about in his victory speech, nor does it include expenditures on “the wall” that Mexico said on Tuesday that they will not be paying for. That already high number is only likely to increase.

This is where economics come into play. When the US government issues bonds, they increase the supply of bonds available for purchase in the marketplace. As with any “good” (a term loosely applied to a financial instrument here), the mechanics of supply and demand dictate that the price of US treasury bonds will fall as their supply increases under constant demand. Because of the way that bond yields are computed, this will drive up the interest rate that US treasuries pay out. For those of you that don’t know, the interest rate paid out by a US treasury bond is referred to as the “risk-free” rate of interest, and it is the rate on which other interest rates are based. This is a fundamental rule of economics and of the credit market. An increase in the risk-free rate will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the ultra-low rates that firms have been borrowing at since 2007 when the Federal Reserve Bank instituted their near-zero interest rate policy. When the cheap credit dries up, it will no longer be economically viable for firms to leverage buybacks on bond issues.

The rising interest rates have an added effect of decreasing demand for stocks. As investors are enticed to flock into treasuries and other bonds for their new, higher yield, their demand for equity investments will fall. This means that the companies that were already accounting for almost 20% of the trading volume on the NYSE by dollar amount will have to spend even MORE money on buying back their own stocks to continue to perpetuate the massive fraud that has been going on since before most of us were born. This increased demand for debt will lead them to issue more bonds which, as we discussed earlier, will only serve to push the interest rate even higher and make the system more unsustainable. When firms cannot efficiently borrow money to finance their price manipulation operations, and a fifth of the demand for equities rapidly disappears, the stock market as we know it will fall apart.

This is why I am scared of Donald Trump. Not because he is a racist, not because he is a misogynist, and not because he has outstanding allegations of child rape and fraud against him. It is his hubris and ignorance to the fundamental laws that govern the functioning of our financial markets (despite his claims to be a “terrific” business man) that scares me the most. You can deport anybody you want, grab whoever’s pussy you want to grab, and rail against any faith you choose, but you cannot implement such a drastic tax proposal and such grandiose public expenditures without collapsing the United States’ (and thus that of most of the world, by ripple effect) equity market.

If you made it this far, congratulations! Now it’s time to answer a few questions that some confused people have been asking me lately.

1) If Donald Trump is so bad for the economy, why is the Dow Jones up? Well friend, I’m sorry to burst your bubble but the DJIA is not the only indicator of a robust and healthy economy. I think this is a result of firms getting in as many buybacks as they can before rates go up, but I could be wrong on that. Take a look at the yield on a 10-year US treasury bond, which is up over 25 basis points from its pre-election level. This means that a lot of smart people who manage a lot of money are scared of what rates will look like in the future, and are selling off their bond holdings. The futures market (a more complicated system that I don’t have time to explain right now without typing an entire other diatribe just like this) for treasuries looks even more grim, down almost 2% since the election.

2) What other impacts could this have outside of the stock market? If you have an adjustable rate mortgage or student loan, now is the time to refinance. Check your cardmember agreements for credit cards, and any auto finance agreements you may have as well.

3) Why didn’t you say anything before the election? I knew this bubble was inflating for a long time, but foresaw it bursting in 2018 when the rest of the market believed that the FRB would hike interest rates. I (along with most other economists) did not foresee what a massive and expedient impact that electing Donald Trump would have on rates, nor was the likelihood of a Trump presidency believed to be that high.

4) How do you feel about Donald Trump? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZ5e94QnWk",WELL

0,1474318665.0,"TL;DR **that sell-side to buy-side career path is disappearing**

Asset managers intend to cut their analyst research budgets by 30 per cent, heaping more pain on the investment banking industry that has already been forced to make thousands of people redundant on the back of falling profitability.

The sharp reduction in how much fund houses are willing to pay for research will be felt most strongly in Europe, where asset managers plan to halve how much they spend on sellside research, according to a poll of 30 global asset management companies and six investment banks.

The cuts to research budgets, which are estimated to be worth $15bn a year, will trigger further job cuts for analysts and the potential elimination of entire research divisions, according to banking and investment experts.

The cuts are creating seismic changes for investment banks, which are having to reshape their operations.

Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive of Quinlan & Associates, the consultancy that carried out the survey, and former head of Asia-Pacific equities strategy at Deutsche Bank, said: “So much research is redundant or unused.

“The buyside does not need 30 brokers to give them the same report.

“Job cuts [among bank analysts] are happening, but not at the pace or speed that it needs to. There is no doubt [banks] will have to reduce costs further. Lesser-rated analysts will be on their way out.”

A separate poll of 2,200 asset management companies carried out last month by BCA Research, an independent research provider, found the number of analyst reports being produced will fall by a fifth, leading to a significant reduction in headcount within banks’ research teams.

Brijesh Malkan, a former Legal & General fund manager and a director at BCA Research, estimates the average portfolio manager receives 500 analyst reports a day. He said: “Eliminating information overload is probably the biggest thing asset managers are looking for.

“Asset managers were receiving 200 pieces of content on Facebook on a weekly basis. That has already halved over the past three months. If you are the 20th-rated analyst on Goldman Sachs’s telecommunications team, you probably need to be looking for a job pretty quickly.”

The drop in asset managers’ research budgets has been driven by new European rules that have forced fund companies to provide a clear budget for research costs to their investors. Previously asset managers paid for research as part of a bundled mix of services that included payments for equity or fixed income trading.

The new regulatory regime has made investment groups question how much research from analysts or brokers is truly worth.

A senior executive at one of Europe’s biggest fund houses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the company has already reduced how much it spends on research. “The likelihood of asset managers paying less for research from sellside analysts is high, especially in Europe. Paying less has already been happening, at least for the for bigger, global players with more purchasing power,” he said.

Other large fund companies are turning to high-quality independent research providers, or doing more research in-house, rather than relying on bank analysis that comes with unclear pricing policies.

Banks have already started to change their business models in response to these changes, but many still support armies of analysts. Banking stocks are currently covered by 465 teams of bank researchers, while telecoms and IT are covered by 283 teams, according to Extel, the data provider.

These pressures have prompted some analysts to move from banking into asset management, according to recruiters and industry insiders.

Earlier this month Huw van Steenis, the well-known analyst at Morgan Stanley, announced he will join Schroders, the UK’s largest listed asset manager.

This followed Alberto Gallo’s departure from the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he was a macro credit strategist, and Gavin Phillips’ decision to leave Jefferies, where he was head of sales trading. Both joined New York-based hedge fund companies earlier this year.

An asset management researcher, who last year worked as a banking analyst, said the drop in research spending by fund companies has generated considerable “nervousness” in investment banks’ research teams.

He added: “There is definitely pressure on the sellside. We are having more meetings with [banking analysts] around how much we want to pay; those conversations will be happening across the industry. There is definitely a squeeze.”",WELL

7:00am -  Arrive to work.

7:00am  - 4:30pm - Try to make as much money for the bank as possible.

4:30pm - Leave work

THE LONG VERSION

6:10AM - iPhone alarm rings. I check my work email for an overnight commission report to check my revenue total from yesterday and my YTD commission number.  I get out of bed.

6:15AM - Shave, wash my hair, eat cereal, eat a piece of fruit, get dressed.

6:40AM - Leave from home.

7:00AM - Arrive to work and head to our morning meeting.  I will typically provide a short re-cap of the developments in my market. There are other speakers as well.  New York, Montreal and London are tuned in via video conference.  Few people are really engaged or paying attention. 

8AM - Drink one small coffee.  Start reading market news, commentary; look at US futures markets, overseas markets and what the bond market is doing to try and get a sense of market tone.

8:30Am - Start working on my morning ""runs"" - a list of various stocks and prices where I am willing to buy and sell/short out of my liability/prop inventory account.  Send that list to all my clients via email along with some daily market commentary.

9:00AM - Start chit-chatting with a few clients on phone and IM because this job is all about relationships. Monitor changes in the market pre-open.  Make sure all my client orders and algos are set up properly for the open.

9:30AM - Market open.  Trades start trickling in to my trade management system - some for client, some for inventory.

10:00AM - I read emails from my backoffice desk telling me certain trades from yesterday are failing to settle with clients.  I follow up with the clients to figure out where the discrepancy is (client usually typed in the wrong price, or wrong quantity or forgot to tell their custodian).

10:30 AM - Get asked by the intern what I want to eat for lunch. I pick something and give him $10. I thank him every time because I feel bad for him.  

11:00 AM - I scour the market for mis-priced securities. I buy cheap and sell expensive.  Call clients.  Leverage trust and relationships to obtain information - what are they trying to buy, what are they trying to sell?  Do I want to be the counter party to their trade? Does it make sense - Is it cheap or expensive?  Trade some stock. 

12:00 AM - Lunch arrives.  I thank the intern again. Eat lunch at my desk. I can never leave my desk.  

12:30 - 4pm - Same thing as @ 11AM.  Negotiate prices with clients and trade blocks.  Read reddit for a bit.  Look at some cars for sale on autotrader.  Trade more stock.  Plan a lunch meeting or drinks after work with a client next week and make reservations.

4:00PM - Market close.  I organize the days trades into various accounts and make sure all my inventory and client trades are pushed to the right accounts. Send out emails and IM to clients advising them on quantity, price, stock symbol and commission and sometimes CC my backoffice.  Client tries to pressure me into paying us 3 cents per share instead of the usual 4. I give in.

4:10PM - On my calculator I do some rough calculation to get an idea of the revenue from client commissions that day.  On good days I feel neutral, on bad days I feel worhless because I have been conditioned to feel like that by the culture here.

4:15PM - I get a call from my backoffice guy advising me how much my inventory is up or down (daily mark-to-market).  I send an email to management so they can see it if they care to.

4:30pm - I leave work

5:00pm - Arrive home.  Go to sleep for one hour because I am completely drained mentally.

As I am aware that prestige matters quite a bit in finance, I am aiming for UC Berkeley, and I have the stats to get in, but UCLA/UCSD are more realistic. 

Anyway, I am majoring in Mathematics/Applied Mathematics/Statistics. I have scoured through many of the course lists at all 3 of these schools, and many allow for students to take courses in various disciplines as long as they're relatively math intensive. 

So, I plan to take multiple Probability/Stats/Finance/Economics courses along with some CS as well. Also, this coming Fall I plan to purchase a little Dell laptop for a couple hundred bucks to begin learning Microsoft Excel as I understand that the industry standard is basically a mastery of Excel. (I have a Mac for personal use and I hear MS Office sucks on it, so whatever.)

Anyway, am I at a disadvantage here? I just hear so many horror stories about unpaid internships being the new ""entry level job."" It's ridiculous out there. How useful am I going to be? I plan on working hard to get any sort of internship next, and the following summer. Preferably at a bank or financial institution, but really anywhere that will take me.  

I don't really know what part of finance I want to work in, because I haven't had any experience in any parts at all, so I'm going in blind here. I'm considering just taking a basic finance/accounting class at my community college, but I really want to focus on my Math classes and not ruin my GPA for transfer. 

Lets say I gain a good understanding of MS Office, I get a good amount of math done, and I have basic understanding of finance...Do I stand a chance? I'm not trying to get into IB here, not going for Wall Street, but hey, California is a competitive market.

He and I ended up emailing back and forth a couple times the following weeks and he ended up not choosing me for the position, but told me to definitely stay in touch. I'm 19, and I don't know much about this industry, but did he really want me to stay in touch? He said ""This industry is all about the connections you make, and you just made your first one, stay in touch!"" ...How do I do that? I figure in a month or two I'll email him asking some question about the industry, and then a month or two after that I'll ask if he knows of any internships opening up around?

at no time did i ask for money or investments to me or towards me. 

Am I wrong in saying that to learn to become a good investor, you need an income stream? 

here's the whole thread. its been removed from the main ureddit subreddit page but im not sure if it will stay up.

I did come across this http://investors.yum.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=117941&p=irol-newsEarnings13 however that is more on the Yum! brands as a whole and not Taco Bell individually. I was hoping to find something that would give a breakdown of earnings by year during the company history but I'll take what I can get.

tldr: Do you guys have any tips on finding earnings for Taco Bell broken down by year since the company began?

thanks everyone!! Also if this should be posted elsewhere I'm sorry and I will move it if you'd like me to.",YUM

Can someone walk me through the process? Or point me to a good tutorial? I've tried using quantlib but there are so many variables to choose and I've never gotten it to match.

Thanks!
